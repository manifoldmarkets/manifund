    projectDescription:
      "I plan to combine existing techniques for automated forecasting - especially for domains where it is hard to get liquidity for the market and not fun for humans. Coalition formation through Shapley values, systematic hyperparameter search, finetuning on resolved predictions using backtesting (questions after knowledge cut off), and incorporatign the latest MLE leader approach in using UCT w. pruning as a subagent of the forecaster. The components exist separately. FutureSearch built the backtesting infrastructure with ensembles of SOTA models. Lightning Rod demonstrated finetuning works, RL environments are straightforward to construct and ammunition plenty. MLE is an established benchmark that tests mid-horizon ML engineering tasks that translates well into quantitative analysis. \n\nThe computational structure resembles algorithmic trading systems. Model params (which prompt? What temp, Which model, etc) form coalition based on past performance. Different aggregation methods apply to different question types. Everything backtests against resolved predictions using historical web snapshots to prevent data leakage.\n\nMy initial explorations with three models and five temperature settings (guided by my instinct) is costing me $300 in openrouter credits. The parameter space grows geometrically. Each model family, hyperparameter, and aggregation method multiplies the search requirements. A smarter strategy than naive Monte Carlo sampling reduces but doesn't eliminate this cost.\n\nBase implementation requires $25000 over three months. MCTS exploration costs $10000 in compute. API access for myriad of tools runs $3000 (AskNews, Jina, Self-Hosted Website scrapping tools with residential IP rotations, etc). Living expenses in are $4000 monthly but that is more cost offloading than a true counterfactual (I have to eat regardless!). This establishes whether the approach works. I’d like to participate in the Metaculus September tournament as well with this setup and see how much cost I can recuperate for Scott and co. (Also good  signal.)\n\nFinetuning the best-performing model costs an additional $16000^[1] for three weeks of 8xH100 time / 2 weeks of 12. This moves from proof-of-concept to deployable system. Total budget with finetuning: $41000.\n\nThe code (backtesting and API integration + RL env) will be public. Model weights on Hugging Face, implementation on GitHub, technical documentation as blog posts. A paper summarizing results for academic venues.\n\nDiscarded Intro repurposed: \nFutureSearch is led by Dan Scwarz, former CTO of Metauclus. When they published their SOTA retrospective forecasting results, they processed a princely total of 299 questions. Lightning Rod Labs finetuned a 14B Qwen to match o1 performance in forecasting and made money on Kalshi. The current Metaculus leader uses o3 with a researcher tool attached. But why not 100,000 questions, a 1T model, and open weights+paper+code+a website you can ask questions instead of two arxiv papers?\n\n[1] Based on qlora, kimi k2-instruct, 16k max token, batch size 16. \n",

The Tigray Health Research Institute (THRI) puts the prevalence of malnutrition in Tigray at 17%, well above the WHO threshold of 15% for a flashing red light emergency.\n\n     There has been a low cost proven cure for severe acute childhood malnutrition for over 40 years, using specially formulated therapeutic food made from peanut butter, powdered milk, specially formulated vitamins and minerals, along with sugar, vegetable oil, and cereal. This is 95% effective in reversing acute malnutrition and it can be administered by a child's mother on an outpatient basis. 10 kg of this ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) administered over several weeks can save a child's life. It costs $40.\n\n     The Fewsi Foundation, a US-based not for profit tax-exempt public charity, has opened a factory in Mekelle, Ethiopia in partnership with Mekelle University, the THRU, and the Tigray Regional Health Bureau to produce and distribute RUTF free of charge through health Bureau clinics. We need additional funding for imported raw materials (powdered milk and vitamin/mineral supplements) and the purchase of a large industrial 40 liter bakery mixer, etc.\n\n   As distribution of this RUTF expands, we hope to scale up by opening other facilities in other cities, such as Axum, Adigrat, and Shire.",

      "1000s of schools bought air purifiers during Covid but stopped using them once vaccines arrived. New evidence shows even low levels of air pollution lead to worse education and health outcomes. We'll convince districts to plug devices back in and produce new air filters customized for schools.",
    projectDescription:
      'The problem I want to fix: Fifty million students in the U.S. spend half their waking hours in poorly ventilated classrooms breathing air that makes them sick and impairs their ability to learn. Respiratory infections cause 164 million missed school days annually, chronic absenteeism has hit crisis levels (~30% of students nationally), and schools serve as amplification centers for community-wide disease transmission. When children get sick at school, they bring illnesses home, causing 98 million lost parent workdays and cascading economic impacts. The air quality crisis hits hardest in low-income schools, which are disproportionately located near highways and industrial facilities. This problem replicates across the globe with even worse outcomes for children in the most polluted cities.\n\nThe solution: Deploy and maintain the next generation of portable air cleaners in every American classroom. This isn’t sexy but it\'s proven, available, and devastatingly underutilized.\n\nThe evidence is striking:\n•\tWhen a gas leak forced installation of air purifiers in California schools, math scores jumped 0.20 standard deviations and English scores 0.18—equivalent to the gains from expensive class-size reduction but at less than 1% of the cost ($30-50 per student vs. $7,000)\n•\tWhen Swedish daycare centers installed air cleaners, illness-related absences plummeted by 55%.\n•\tA recent randomized controlled trial found that air purifiers cut student absenteeism by 12.5%, with even larger effects for students with higher starting rates of absenteeism.\n•\tAn analysis of 10,000 U.S. school districts revealed that schools located downwind of highways, exposed to chronic air pollution, showed persistently lower achievement and higher absenteeism. \n•\tFixing ventilation, removing mold, and upgrading filters in schools led to test score gains of 0.10 to 0.15 standard deviations.\n•\tIsraeli students performed worse on high-stakes exams when air pollution spiked on test day. Similar results were found in China.\n•\tJust two hours of breathing filtered air improved executive function scores. Each 1 μg/m³ reduction in fine particulate matter was associated with a 0.10% cognitive improvement. \n\nThis is the right time to work on this. \n•\tFirst, thousands of air purifiers purchased during COVID sit unplugged in storage closets across American schools, gathering dust while children miss millions of school days from preventable illness. Speaking with school leaders in different parts of the country, it is becoming clear that thousands of schools (potentially as many as 10% of schools in the U.S.) purchased air purifiers during the pandemic with government relief funds, but most have stopped using them more or less since vaccines arrived. These devices, worth hundreds of millions in taxpayer investment, sit idle in storage but are fully functional. Meanwhile, chronic absenteeism has exploded post-pandemic, creating a crisis that superintendents desperately want – and need – to solve.\n•\tWe’re living through a major paradigm shift in airborne disease. The medical and public health establishments believed so fervently that Covid-19 could not be airborne—that contagious respiratory diseases were predominantly spread by direct contact and large droplets, and only very rarely by aerosols that can float through the air for hours and infect people far away. It\'s why we all sang "Happy Birthday" while washing our hands, wiped down bananas, and went to stores with plexiglass barriers, and why took many public health agencies 18 months to declare Covid-19 was airborne. We finally now know that many respiratory infections have significant airborne spread, including influenza, TB, RSV, measles, the common cold, and more. Schools, like most of the country, have not yet caught up to this generational paradigm shift.\nScale Potential: The U.S. has 13,500 school districts, but they follow a power-law distribution: just 266 districts (2%) serve one-third of all students. By focusing on these large urban districts first, we can protect 25 million students while building proof points for broader adoption. Our tools will be designed for easy adoption: model board resolutions, pre-written federal funding applications, and turnkey implementation guides.\n',
    backgroundQualifications:
      "My work in airborne infectious disease started in 2010. I spent my freshman year summer in South Africa, where my family is originally from. I worked as a research assistant on a study on hospital acquired tuberculosis infections in a small deep rural part of KwaZulu Natal. Despite the well-known high rates of hospital-acquired infections, it was notoriously difficult to sustain basic but critical protective measures like opening windows and doors during the cold winter months. Here was one of civilization’s most feared pathogens and our defenses were so rudimentary and feeble. By that point, eight members of that hospital had already died of drug-resistant TB.\n\nFor the past two and a half years I’ve been helping to build Blueprint Biosecurity, a nonprofit dedicated to achieving breakthroughs in humanity’s ability to prevent pandemics. We are deploying about $12M to accelerate the most promising technologies that suppress transmission of airborne disease, such as far-UVC.\n\nMy background originally, though, was in education. In college I co-founded Panorama Education, a YCombinator-backed education data analytics startup that now serves tens of thousands of schools across all 50 states. When we started Panorama the conventional wisdom in Silicon Valley was that ed-tech companies would fail because you couldn’t sell to districts and teachers wouldn’t pay. I led our sales at Panorama as a Junior and Senior and proved to our funders that you can sell to districts and build a viable SaaS company if you master their incentives and speak the right language. We grew to a company with hundreds of employees serving millions of students. \n\nSix months ago, these parallel tracks of my career converged into a single insight: we're sitting on one of the most cost-effective interventions ever discovered for both education and public health, and we're largely ignoring it. \n\n\nReference 1: Siobhan Brenton (siobhan.brenton@blueprintbiosecurity.org)\nReference 2: Jacob Swett (jacob.swett@blueprintbiosecurity.org)\nReference 3: Nic Spaull (nicspaull@gmail.com)\n\n",

    projectDescription:
      'Manufacturing many therapeutic and research proteins remains a bottleneck: half of biologics fail to scale at the manufacturing stage, and even “successful” proteins often require months to years of strain and process optimization. In developing nations important medicines like insulin, erythropoietin (EPO), and recombinant Hep B vaccines face supply issues due to manufacturing cost and under-developed cold chains. With many drugs coming off patent, cheap manufacturing of biosimilars would broaden access to these important medicines. Yeast has long been used as a production platform for biologics due to their cheaper media requirements and lack of viral contamination risk, but relatively poor titers and non-human post-translational modifications has led them to be disfavored over the more costly mammalian CHO cells. \n\nThe ultimate goal of the company is to discover and evolve genes which enable cheap, efficient, facile manufacturing of important proteins; changing the biomanufacturing landscape by enabling production of previously impossible proteins, and enabling facile, cheap production of current medicines. I am trying to start a company utilizing a continuous directed evolution platform I developed (OrthoRep Assisted Continuous Library Evolution, ORACLE) which continuously mutagenizes large gene libraries in yeast, allowing for unmatched search of sequence space when placed under evolutionary pressure. I have already shown that unexpected or unknown genes evolve to solve imposed evolutionary constraints in a way that is, to the best of my knowledge, unprecedented. To apply this approach to protein manufacturing, I need to build systems which couple secretion of a protein of interest to cell growth or fluorescence. \n\nBy iterating selection in pooled cultures and switching between orthogonal screening methods (growth-based, FACS, droplet sorting), ORACLE should uncover non-obvious chaperones, trafficking factors, and detoxifiers that increase titers of both tractable and previously unproducible targets.\n\nTo start, we will:\n\n1.\tBuild and validate general selection tools (toxin tolerance, stability, secretion via invertase trap or surface display, chaperone-guided UPR reporters, emulsion FADS).\n2.\tRun pilot ORACLE campaigns on a representative set of 8–12 proteins (cytokines, hormones, enzymes, toxins, clotting factors), to isolate evolved genes that boost secretion proxies by more than 2x.\n3.\tCharacterize and port top hits for mechanism (folding vs. trafficking), combine effectors in polycistronic cassettes, and test portability in CHO and Pichia pastoris, aiming for ≥25% of hits active in all systems.\n4.\tContract a 1–5 L bench-scale fermentation at a CRO to validate that evolved strains recapitulate shake-flask titer gains in bioreactors, measuring purity by ELISA/HPLC and glycosylation fidelity by lectin assays.\n\nThe initial goal is to establish a rapid, generalizable discovery engine for secretion-enhancing genes, shortening the development timeline for novel biologics from ~90 days to ~30 days, lowering costs, and unlocking production of complex and post-translationally modified proteins currently out of reach. \n\nGiven preliminary, still unpublished data generated in my final months of grad school I have a high degree of confidence this system will be productive. To achieve our long term goals of transforming biomanufacturing, this project will require more investment but a relatively small up front amount will allow me to get started, delivering proof of concept and building momentum for further efforts.

Neutrality between opposing viewpoints does not necessarily equate to accuracy or truthfulness, especially when some viewpoints (like flat-Earthism) are simply incorrect.\n\n<Key Contributions: New Metrics for Bias and Truth-Seeking>\nWe introduce a rigorous distinction between two essential metrics:\n- Ideological Bias (IB): Captures the tendency of LLMs to describe certain political factions or viewpoints in systematically more negative or positive terms, regardless of the accuracy of those descriptions.\n- Epistemic Integrity (EI): Measures the model’s capacity for fair hypothesis testing, precise perspective-taking, and accuracy-maximizing probabilistic forecasting.\n\nThese are unified into a Truth-Ideology State Vector (TISV), which characterizes an AI as a point in a two-dimensional space: one axis for ideological bias, one for epistemic integrity. This makes it possible to optimize AIs according to different societal or regulatory preferences—for instance, prioritizing ideological neutrality, truth-seeking, or some weighted combination of both.\n\n<Approaches to Measuring Bias and Truth-Seeking in LLMs>\nWe propose four complementary approaches to characterize bias and epistemic rigor in AI systems. \n\n<Ideological Bias (IB)>\n- Approach 1 (Disparate Epistemic Impact): Analyzes whether LLMs respond more favorably to one political faction than another, as measured by sentiment/stance/political-orientation in LLMs’ responses about public figures, viewpoints or institutions. Recognizes that such biases may reflect reality rather than model defects, and that these measures can easily become entangled in partisan debates.\n<Epistemic Integrity (EI)>\n- Approach 2 (Fair Hypothesis Testing): Uses “turnabout tests” to assess whether the model applies consistent standards to ideologically opposed claims (e.g., measures whether LLMs are equally likely to accept or reject claims depending on the political valence of those claims.\n\n- Approach 3 (Ideological Turing Tests). Evaluates the LLM’s ability to accurately and convincingly reproduce arguments from multiple ideological perspectives, without caricature or distortion. Compares the linguistic patterns, verbosity, and use of moral foundations in responses generated from different political stances.\n\n- Approach 4 (Calibrated Probabilistic Forecasting): Assesses whether LLMs can make accurate predictions about future events, regardless of the political context. Compares forecasting accuracy when the model is primed with left- or right-leaning personas.\n\n\nWe argue that most existing studies on AI political bias focus on the first (and least conclusive) approach—disparate impact—while neglecting the more philosophically robust criteria of hypothesis testing, perspective-taking, and forecasting accuracy (Approaches 2, 3 and 4).\n\n<Approaches to Mitigating Ideological Bias and Maximizing Truth-Seeking in LLMs>\nWe plan to explore several strategies for reducing political bias and improving truth-seeking behaviour in LLMs:\n\n- Debiasing Prompts: Evaluating the effectiveness of prompts designed to encourage value-neutral forecasting using best practices like those found in PI’s book: "Superforecasting" to optimize TISV.\n\n- Reward-Based Fine-Tuning: Encapsulate the metrics in approaches 1, 2, 3 and 4 above into reward functions during post-training reinforcement fine-tuning. By optimizing with these targeted rewards, the model can be guided to reduce measurable political bias and epistemic distortions.\n\n- Reasoning Traces in Supervised Fine-Tuning: Use test time scaling to promote political neutrality and epistemic integrity in LLM outputs. Specifically, we suggest leveraging recent data-efficient supervised fine-tuning methods that prime LLMs to produce reasoning traces and adapt this approach to foster epistemic integrity and/or mitigate political bias in LLMs’ outputs. \n\n<Conclusion>\nWe have presented a framework for measuring and optimizing the balance between ideological bias and truth-seeking in LLMs. By separating these concepts and offering clear metrics, our approach enables developers and policymakers to design and evaluate AI systems using transparent, scientifically grounded criteria. This not only clarifies AI behavior but also supports regulatory compliance by allowing model behavior to be tailored to context-specific needs.\n',

      "We are running a campaign to fight the UK's restrictive speech laws and to produce research on the state of free speech in the UK.",
    projectDescription:
      "SPEAK UK (speakuk.org) is a non-partisan project led by Sam Glover, Duncan McClements, and Stella Tsantekidou, aiming to research and fight the UK's restrictive speech laws. We aim to launch a social media campaign in the style of last year’s successful campaign to ban the  American Bully XL dog in the UK. The basic modus operandi of the Bully XL campaign was to create a pipeline to identify cases where people had been seriously injured or killed by one of these dogs, get them viral on Twitter or other social media platforms, and create strong pressure on the government to ban the dog. Dr. Lawrence Newport (who we’ve met with several times) began this campaign in June 2023, and the dog was banned in February 2024. \n\nWe think we can do something similar. Duncan McClements, our Head of Research, is creating a pipeline to scrape court cases and news articles to identify people who have been arrested and/or convicted of speech-related offences that we think the public will be particularly sympathetic to (you can see some examples on our website at speakuk.org, in the Case Explorer). Sam and Stella will then push the cases on social media, on television (Stella is often invited on UK TV as a political pundit), in newspapers, and so on. We think we’re likely to get attention relatively quickly and make the issue of free speech in the UK much more salient, applying significant pressure to the Labour government.\n\nThere are a few points worth making here about why we think this is tractable and why we think it’s important (as well as why this will be significantly harder than the American XL Bully Campaign):\n\n- The American Bully campaign did not require new primary legislation (i.e. a law passed by the government in the House of Commons), it only required a Statutory Instrument, which is much easier for a government to do (and has a much lower opportunity cost). For this reason, we should be frank about the fact that this will be a much more difficult campaign than the Bully XL campaign.\n\n- That being said, we think there are reasons to be optimistic. Most notably, that the Reform UK Party is looking for policies like this to push on, as is potential future Conservative leader Robert Jenrick (current odds of him as next leader are around 44% on the betting markets), as is (to a lesser extent) current Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch. \n\n- After the successful Bully XL campaign, Lawrence Newport began a new campaign, Crush Crime, to tackle crime in the UK. This has been picked up by both Jenrick and Reform UK, who are eager to find policies that they can use to broaden their appeal. We think a similar thing could happen if/when speech goes viral. This could either result in Reform UK implementing our policies (or very similar ones) if they get into government, Jenrick/Badenoch implementing our policies if they get into government, or Labour feeling under pressure to adopt more liberal policies on free speech, even if those policies don’t go as far as we would like.\n\n- Importantly, our campaign is non-partisan. Most free speech campaigns in the UK (e.g. Free Speech Union) are extremely right-coded, and have no chance of appealing to a Labour government. The Free Speech Union has been keen on pushing anti-vaccine messages and is more interested in cancellations than legislation. We think we have a separate focus, are much more willing to work with all parties, and are much more likely to create broad support for liberal policies.\n\nWhy do we think this is important? 33 people per day are arrested for speech-related offences in the UK. It isn’t clear how many of these people are being arrested unjustly as opposed to genuine cases of sustained, targeted harassment. We think we can issue FOI requests to get a much better understanding of free speech in the UK, and to figure out which laws are the most egregious (and likely to result in genuinely unjust arrests for speech), and how we can repeal those laws. We do know that there are examples of people who have been arrested or convicted that we believe should not have been. \n\nExamples include:\n\n- Palestine Action supporters (note: including supporters who are not members) have been arrested (charged pending) for holding up signs that say things like ‘I support Palestine -Action’. This is possible because Palestine Action are a proscribed terrorist group in the UK, so any expression of support is illegal. \n- Lee Dunn, who was jailed for 8 weeks for reposting memes that were regarded as racist at the height of the Southport riots last year.\n- Maxie Allen was arrested and held for 11 hours (but not charged, after a 5 week investigation) for criticising their child’s school on WhatsApp in a private conversation.\n\nWe think that this is simply mad, and that it leaves the door open for future authoritarian governments to abuse the relevant laws to either proscribe groups they don’t like as terrorists or to arrest critics of the government for being grossly offensive.\n",

      'Increase compute available to find more solar system objects (including NEOs) hidden in astronomical databases using a custom, proven algorithm I’ve already implemented and support the development of a new algorithm capable of finding more objects currently under development.',
    projectDescription:
      'I am an independent researcher that develops algorithms that discover solar system objects hidden in databases of transient detections.  This award would support development and scaling of my custom implementation of HelioLinC which has the demonstrated ability to recover greater than 95% of objects from the Rubin Observatory’s DP0.3 simulation data and is actively finding new objects in the Isolated Tracklet File (ITF) produced by the Minor Planet Center (MPC) that the MPC itself did not find.\n\nHelioLinC “links” detections of solar system objects on different nights.  It essentially looks for “dots” in astronomical images that weren’t present at a location previously and aren’t there later and asks: “does this transient dot connect to other transient dots at other times with a specific orbit?”  If you can describe an orbit that passes through a bunch of dots at their observation times, you can validate that these dots belong to a singular moving object in the solar system – an asteroid most commonly.\n\nIn late 2025 or early 2026, Rubin Observatory will begin its Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).  Rubin will produce the largest database of dots ever assembled.  This database will contain millions of asteroids, near-Earth objects (NEOs), trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs), interstellar objects (ISOs) and maybe even the hypothesized Planet Nine – but we need to pull them out of the data first.  \n\nWhile I will have access to Rubin’s database of dots, I do not currently have the compute necessary process data at the scale Rubin produces it.  If I receive this award, the most important thing I will do is purchase new computers to enable Rubin-scale data processing.  Additionally, I currently process data in the MPC’s ITF (the central database of unidentified dots), but will be able to do a deeper search and find more objects with the additional compute.  I’m particularly interested in the potential to deepen my search for NEOs which might pose a threat to Earth and are some of the most computationally expensive objects to recover.\n\nI am also in the process of creating a new linking algorithm which I’m calling HyperLinC-1 (Inverse HyperLinC).  This new algorithm builds on all the things I’ve learned developing HelioLinC over the years to enable searches over a longer duration but with fewer same-night detections.  HelioLinC currently requires at least two dots per night to recover an object; HyperLinC-1 would only require one.  This allows you to find objects that are only detected once per night.  Unlike my HelioLinC implementation, which is already fully implemented and finding new objects, HyperLinC-1 is still speculative.  But I’ve already started building the algorithm and have evidence from results to date that the capabilities will exceed that of HelioLinC.\n\nI currently support my independent research through part-time non-astronomy work (retail web stuff) and personal savings.  With this funding I will be able to acquire the computing resources that will enable increased object discovery and dedicate more time to moving object research.',
    backgroundQualifications:
      'I’m qualified to work on solar system object detection because I already detect a lot of new solar system objects with HelioLinC – custom software I’ve written for that purpose [1].  The Minor Planet Center keeps track of how many objects contributors “identify” – that is: link dots together with other dots in a database of dots to confirm the identification of a new object.  In 2024 I was in the top 10 of ITF-ITF linkers (the category which results in newly designated objects).  I am among the last of the contributors to look at the data (due to professional institutions having live database feeds while I currently have a snapshot), which leads me to believe I might be finding at least some of the harder to discover objects.\n\nIn addition to actually identifying new objects, I have also made contributions to Rubin Observatory’s search tools [2].  Starting in 2026, Rubin will use a different implementation of HelioLinC than mine (there are 2-3 variants of HelioLinC in the community which differ fairly significantly) to search for new objects.  Rubin has adopted my “RR clustering phase space” as one of its search techniques.  This is one thing that my algorithm and Rubin’s have in common, but there are many more that set us apart (especially in the very near and very distant object category) and suggests that our separate techniques will not fully overlap in the objects they find.\n\nFinally, I attend and contribute at professional astronomy conferences.  Just this past month I’ve presented a poster on a HelioLinC optimization that reduces compute time requirements for near-Earth objects – among the most compute intensive objects to find due to their non-linearly varying heliocentric distance in time requiring more hypotheses than other bodies in the solar system [3].\n\nOh, I guess I should mention my academic background too.

      'Improve epidemic preparedness in Liberia through community-driven risk communication and rapid rumor management systems.',
    projectDescription:
      'This project aims to enhance epidemic preparedness in rural Liberia by building a community-led risk communication and rumor management system. It will empower local communities to detect, report, and respond to misinformation and behavioral factors that influence the spread of infectious diseases. The initiative addresses a key weakness in outbreak preparedness: the gap between early warning systems and real-time community action.\n\nBackground and Rationale:\nFollowing the 2014–16 Ebola outbreak, Liberia made strides in strengthening disease surveillance. However, recent Mpox cases revealed ongoing challenges in risk communication, timely community engagement, and misinformation control—especially in rural areas. A UNICEF–Ministry of Health U-Report poll during the Mpox outbreak uncovered low risk perception, misinformation, and stigma, particularly among vulnerable populations. Social media monitoring confirmed that false information was spreading faster than official messaging, underscoring the urgent need for trusted, audience-specific communication rooted in local realities.\n\nMany communities remain disconnected from formal health systems. While Liberia’s CEBS and IDSR systems help detect outbreaks, they are not designed to capture social behavior trends or real-time public sentiment. This project will bridge that gap by embedding risk communication and rumor tracking into existing community structures, creating a feedback loop between the population and the public health system.\n\nObjectives:\n\nEstablish a community-based rumor tracking and response system in three rural districts.\n\nTrain community health workers, radio hosts, and youth leaders in epidemic communication and misinformation management.\n\nSet up a simple dashboard to analyze and share rumor and feedback data with district health offices.\n\nCo-create and deliver locally relevant health messages that promote trust and behavior change.\n\nEvaluate the project’s impact on health knowledge, trust in health authorities, and rumor prevalence.\n\nImplementation Plan:\n\nPhase 1: Planning & Community Engagement (Months 1–2)\n\nIdentify pilot districts with MoH and local authorities.\n\nConduct rapid assessments and stakeholder mapping.\n\nForm Community Risk Communication Committees (CRCCs).\n\nDevelop a social behavior change communication (SBCC) toolkit with local input.\n\nPhase 2: Capacity Building & Setup (Months 3–4)\n\nTrain 60+ community actors in risk communication and rumor tracking.\n\nSet up WhatsApp-based channels for rumor reporting.\n\nDevelop a user-friendly dashboard for data visualization and analysis.\n\nLaunch radio programming and local theatre performances to address identified concerns.\n\nPhase 3: Feedback Loops & Real-Time Messaging (Months 5–6)\n\nWeekly collection and analysis of rumor data by community focal points.\n\nAdapt radio scripts and messages in response to real-time feedback.\n\nCollaborate with surveillance teams to triangulate community insights with health data.\n\nProvide community-level feedback to build transparency and trust.\n\nPhase 4: Evaluation & Documentation (Months 7–8)\n\nConduct pre- and post-intervention surveys on health knowledge and risk perception.\n\nAssess behavior change and communication uptake.\n\nDocument best practices and produce recommendations for scale-up.\n\nExpected Outcomes:\n\nA functional, community-owned rumor tracking and response system.\n\nImproved understanding of disease risk and preventive behaviors.\n\nStrengthened trust between communities and public health actors.\n\nA replicable model for RCCE integration into epidemic preparedness frameworks.\n\nAlignment with Effective Altruism Principles:\nThis project embodies core EA values:\n\nEvidence-Informed: Builds on known gaps and international RCCE guidelines.\n\nTractable: Uses existing community structures and low-tech tools.\n\nNeglected: Risk communication at the local level remains underfunded.\n\nScalable: Can be adapted across districts or other LMICs post-evaluation.\n\nUse of Funds (Estimated Budget):\n\nCommunity training & toolkit development – $3,000\n\nMobile-based reporting & rumor dashboard – $2,000\n\nRadio & local media content creation – $2,000\n\nMonitoring & evaluation (including surveys) – $1,500\n\nCoordination, logistics & documentation – $1,500\n\nTotal grant requested: $10,000 USD\n\nConclusion: As outbreaks become more frequent and complex, especially in fragile health systems, the importance of resilient and people-centered communication systems cannot be overstated. This project leverages my recent fieldwork in Liberia and aims to build a sustainable model that enables communities to act quickly and confidently in the face of emerging threats. With ACX Grant support, we can strengthen epidemic readiness by making trusted information just as contagious as the disease.',

My expertise bridges technical epidemiology, social science, and participatory methods—precisely what this project demands.\n\nThese combined experiences make me well positioned to design and implement a community-led, evidence-informed, and culturally grounded risk communication model in Liberia.',

      'Help previously ineligible living organ donors become eligible to donate',
    projectDescription:
      'More than enough people sign up to donate their kidney each year, yet roughly 98% of potential living donors never make it to surgery. Over 30% of potential donors are ruled out for addressable health reasons, like being a few pounds overweight. Despite the life-saving potential of living donation, the current system lacks programs or pathways to support these motivated individuals in overcoming barriers to donation. \n\nProject Donor supports prospective living donors who have been ruled out of donation for addressable barriers. We provide free, targeted support for the most common barriers to donation, including programs for weight loss, smoking cessation, blood pressure control, mental health, and financial assistance. These programs, paired with our 1:1 case management, provide participants with the support they need to overcome their barriers and donate.\n\nSince our first donation in February 2023, Project Donor has onboarded over 1,000 participants and enabled 88 successful transplants. We have over 400 active participants working towards donation across our 78 partnered transplant centers, and a 16% donation rate– 8x the national average. Since launching, the program has grown at an average month-over-month rate of 14%, reflecting strong and accelerating demand among prospective donors.\n\nOur program is also notably cost effective. We spend just $65 per participant per month on our program (including administrative costs), and this number is decreasing. We expect by December 2025, it will cost $59 per participant per month, or $66 per QALY. This translates to ~$2400 for each life saved, comparable to current GiveWell standards for effective charities.\n\nIn the past year alone we have seen incredible growth, doubling our number of partnered transplant centers and increasing our rate of new participants; however, this is just a start. We want to reach the entire market, partnering with all 215 transplant centers nationwide and reaching the estimated 14,000 annual potential donors, yielding 2,000 annual counterfactual living kidney transplants. \n\nIn addition, we want to continue to push for system-wide change in eligibility practices. Eligibility is often treated by centers as a fixed status; donors ruled out during initial screenings are left with no path forward. Project Donor believes eligibility is malleable and can change through low-lift behavioral interventions. We are starting to see this view being adopted by transplant centers like UCSF, who increased their BMI cutoff to support more previously rejected donors.\n\nBy combining direct support with systems-change advocacy, Project Donor is working to ensure every motivated donor has a real chance to save a life, and no donor is left behind.\n',

      'We are requesting $100,000 to bridge the gap to sustainable funding. Project Donor is entering a pilot contract with the National Kidney Registry (NKR), under which we’ll receive payment for supporting up to 100 participants. If the pilot succeeds, this partnership could become a sustainable funding model, covering our operating costs as we grow. A full contract with NKR could mean over 4,000 people on our program annually and over 600 annual counterfactual kidney donations.  However, demand for our program is already outpacing current capacity. Every day, more prospective donors are joining, and we urgently need to expand staff and infrastructure to deliver strong results during the NKR pilot. This funding will allow us to hire a full-time case manager and to cover operating costs during the NKR pilot. Currently, we rely on part-time student case managers with limited hours and high turnover. A full-time case manager would be at least 30% more cost-effective and paid at $78,000 annually (including benefits). In addition, $19,500 will sustain our basic operating costs over the course of the initial pilot phase—approximately $13 per participant per month for 500 participants over 3 months—including essential tools like scales and smoking cessation resources.

      ' Use a new and more precise form of gene editing to increase the nutritional content of corn, primarily for Central America and Sub-Saharan Africa. ',
    projectDescription:
      'One paragraph TLDR: Malnutrition is bad, one elegant solution is to make the food people already eat more nutritious. Prime editing is a new biotechnology that’s just starting to work reliably in plants and should enable some nutrition-increases we can’t achieve with basic gene editing, and we’ve found a lab just starting to get it working in corn. We’ve already convinced them to use some biofortification genes as their proof-of-principle, and are looking for dedicated funding to a) move their troubleshooting at faster-than-academic pace and b) help them continue past the minimum for a scientific paper and get to a more practical real-world proof-of-principle.\n\n\nDetail: Malnutrition is one of the largest-scale and highest-tractability problems in the world, responsible for a huge amount of DALYs. We’ve made amazing progress over the last 5 decades, but 20% of people are still deficient in essential vitamins and nutrients. This causes slower physical and mental growth in children, higher risk of infections, and increased mortality. One elegant solution is biofortification - making crops more nutritious. Biofortification’s basic logic is that both economics and culture lead poor people to eat a ton of a staple food, and it’s really hard to change that (we’ve tried!). \n\nThe most famous biofortification project is Golden Rice, designed to solve vitamin A deficiency. It’s super cool (it got me into plant biotechnology), but it has failed to have much impact because it’s GMO and ran up against political opposition. Semilla Nueva is having a lot of success with non-GMO biofortified corn, and we’re in the process of expanding into gene editing. USDA regulation (which many other countries follow) is that gene edited crops can generally avoid GMO designation, so we think this could be a powerful technology without the political and regulatory blocks that stopped Golden Rice. \n\nGene editing changes existing genes rather than putting new ones in, and generally the goal is one of these three: eliminating expression of a gene, increasing the amount of expression of gene, or making a very targeted change to the gene product such as shifting a specific amino acid in the resulting protein to change binding or enzymatic function. Basic CRISPR is great for the first of these goals, pretty bad for the second two (in plants - it’s better in some other organisms).\n\nA newer tech that’s much better at the second two goals is prime editing. Prime editing lets you make the exact change you want, rather than just making a random indel at the location you want like basic CRISPR. To increase gene expression, you can use prime editing to change a promoter to include a binding site for a transcription factor that, say, increases expression kernels - this could be a useful tool to increase expression of a nutrition biosynthesis or transport gene in that tissue. Changing a particular amino acid in a protein is even simpler, you just put the right nucleotides to code for that amino acid into a pegRNA and re-write that specific part of the gene.\n\nSemilla Nueva’s breeding program finds high-yielding and well adapted seeds, and then uses a slow (4-7 years) and expensive (200-500k per seed) backcrossing process to convert them to be more nutritious. My primary job at Semilla Nueva has been to make converting seeds from conventional to biofortified faster and cheaper using gene editing. To do that, I’ve built a huge list of all the genetic changes one might make to improve the nutritional properties of corn for the most important nutrients missing in widespread diets - zinc, iron, and protein quality. This list is derived from ~all academic literature on the topic as well as some of our proprietary data from testing the nutrient levels of over 10,000 types of corn in our breeding program. In many cases, these genetic changes have been demonstrated to improve nutrition in an academic lab setting, but not under field conditions with modern cultivars rather than academic “lab-strains”. We are testing many of these changes with basic CRISPR, but some targets will only work with prime editing.\n\nWe already partner fairly extensively with CIMMYT (a giant in this space, Norman Borlaug’s org), and recently they got prime editing working in wheat. They’re just starting the project of getting it up and running in corn. Given their extensive success doing basic CRISPR on corn and the fact that they got prime editing working well in wheat, they’re pretty likely to succeed, and to get a nice scientific paper showing they can do the benchwork. \n\nCurrently they have no funding dedicated specifically to the prime editing work, and are funding it from scraps from various other grants. Dedicated funding would allow this work to move faster and test a larger number of candidate genes, increasing the odds we get a good proof-of-principle to drive additional funding to get prime-editing-biofortified corn all the way into farmers’ hands.\n',
    backgroundQualifications:
      'Me as an individual: I was inspired to work in this field by EA reasoning about 15 years ago when I learned about Golden Rice, and have spent the bulk of that time doing the long training process to become an expert in the field - a broad scientific study focused on biology for undergrad, a masters in plant synthetic biology at Cambridge, and a PhD in plant biology begun at UC Davis and completed at UC Berkeley. I have done a lot of bench plant biology - my papers are spread across a variety of sub-disciplines, but the overarching goal was always to build the skillset to be good at biofortification. I’ve closely followed the field for many years, and either personally know or am familiar with the work of many of the leading scientists.\n\nSince joining Semilla Nueva, I’ve been responsible for our gene editing program, which has resulted in many dozens of different “lines” of plants edited for nutrition-relevant genes, which are currently being grown in the field in preparation for nutritional phenotyping. The most knowledgeable reference for my scientific background and skill is my former PhD advisor, Patrick Shih: pmshih@berkeley.edu\n\nSemilla Nueva as an organization: While I was in academia, Semilla Nueva was out in the world figuring out what works. After a few false starts including trying to convince farmers to grow a greater variety of crops, the organization settled on biofortification as a way to improve human nutrition. Unlike Golden Rice, Semilla Nueva’s biofortified corn is not GMO, and therefore has faced much less political opposition, allowing for rapid growth - in 2024, over 30,000 farmers in Guatemala grew our seed, and we’re starting to see population-level nutritional effects. Our corn is higher in zinc and iron than conventional, and has higher “protein quality”, meaning a higher level of the normally-rare-in-corn essential amino acids lysine and tryptophan. In addition to the improved nutrition, we have two other pillars of our model: we use a subsidy to incentivize seed companies to sell the seeds at reduced prices (since we’ve figured out poor people won’t pay more for more nutritious foods, a key false assumption that we think ruined some previous attempts at biofortification). This allows our medium-yield biofortified seed to be sold at prices normally expected for low-yield outdated seeds, which means many farmers growing our seed see their yield and profits substantially increase. \n\nInitially, that subsidy has been funded through donations to our organization, and as we transition to better seeds the subsidy amount should decrease over time. Our final pillar and path to truly huge scale is through convincing governments (mostly by letting the farmers growing our seeds convince their own representatives) to cover the cost of the subsidy of biofortified seeds as a public health program. Currently the Guatemalan government is covering 70% of the subsidy there, El Salvador is piloting the implementation of a similar program, and we hope to see other governments do the same or even take on the full subsidy cost as we scale across Central America and into Africa.\n\nA reference that can speak to our scientific strategy: Ray Riley has worked in plant biotechnology for >40 years and is a member of our scientific advisory board: raymarriley@gmail.com\n',

      '$10,000 will be enough to significantly accelerate our efforts in this area. We will spend that funding on:  1. Greenhouse space: The first stage of the prime editing protocol (as well as most corn gene editing protocols) is dissecting out immature embryos, which are then sterilized and go into axenic growth in petri dishes to do the editing. To iterate and troubleshoot at a reasonable pace, you need fresh embryos every week, which means you need to plant weekly and grow the plants “out of season”, which means using greenhouse space which is always scarce. CIMMYT (like the universities I’ve worked at, I think this is pretty standard) has an internal “greenhouse space renting” system to allocate that space and pay for the running costs (people to plant, water, weed, etc - it’s better to have a dedicated team do this than have your postdocs doing it). Currently they’re basically just growing in whatever space happens to be available, but they’ll get prime editing working much faster if they have a dedicated chunk of space to have a couple plants each at every stage of growth between sowing seed and harvesting embryos from mature plants.  2. Targeting more genes: Biotechnology is fickle, specific genes end up failing for all sorts of reasons at all stages in the process. Some failures are technical (e.g. can’t prime edit that gene), others are biological (you make the change you want, and either it doesn’t give the phenotype you want, or it causes some other negative effect that prevents it from being useful). The main way we prepare for these inevitable failures is to take many shots on goal - I have over 170 genes in my candidate list, of which about 60 are best suited to prime editing (rather than basic CRISPR KOs, which we’ll use preferentially if they work since the technology is tried-and-true at this point). CIMMYT primarily cares about getting a scientific paper, which pretty much just means they need to show that prime editing makes the genetic change they want. We’re more interested in an improved seed that works better in farmers’ fields, so we’ll need to take more shots on goal. Having dedicated funding will enable the CIMMYT team to iterate and troubleshoot with just a few targets, then run prime editing on a larger set of targets once they’ve gotten it working. This vastly increases the chances that we end up with a viable proof-of-principle that has the genetic change we targeted, has the nutritional change we actually care about, and doesn’t have any dealbreaker side-effects.',

      'We are already engaged in a purely academic version of this project, which our partners have agreed to do without any further incentive than scientific publication and the resulting prestige. However, this is happening only at academic science pace, and only for the minimum viable number of prime edits required to get a nice paper, rather than the larger scale that one would pursue for the development of a product aiming to ultimately reach farmers’ hands.\n\nThis project is too early-stage for most of our donors, who prefer donating to either our existing program (backcross breeding-generated biofortified corn) or our more basic gene editing program. While some of our other work has been funded by GiveWell, we think this is also too early-stage to be of interest to them.\n\nI should also note that 55% of our 2025 budget came from USAID and was cut last winter. We’ve made some cuts and raised additional funds to cover our main operations, but we are not in a position to be funding more speculative early stage research like prime editing for the foreseeable future, despite being convinced that it could be a powerful tool. If this works well, we probably will be in a position in a year or two to push this from “proof of principle” to getting it into competitive seeds and out to tens of thousands of farmers.\n\nWe will probably reach out to Open Philanthropy and other funders of more basic research that stands to potentially unlock cost-effective humanitarian interventions, but other funding is uncertain and likely much slower than an ACX grant, so the most likely counterfactual is that this project remains without dedicated funding and progresses slowly and at minimum-academic-paper scale.\n',

      'Pilot a scalable, direct-to-farmer fish welfare program in Nigeria, training 400+ farmers across five clusters to adopt and maintain humane handling, slaughter, and welfare practices through hands-on field training and ongoing farm support.',
    projectDescription:
      'iCareFish – Humane Fish Care From the Ground Up is Nigeria’s first direct-to-farmer fish welfare program. Nigeria is one of Africa’s largest aquaculture producers, with over 676 million fish slaughtered annually—most without humane handling or slaughter standards. Despite growing global attention to fish welfare, no program in Nigeria currently delivers scalable, field-level behavior change interventions through trusted aquaculture clusters.\n\nBaseline Research and Identified Need\nPrior to launching iCareFish, we conducted comprehensive baseline research across targeted aquaculture clusters in Delta, Edo, Kwara, and Lagos States. This research revealed critical welfare gaps, including widespread inhumane handling and slaughter practices, poor environmental conditions such as inadequate oxygenation and crowding, and a lack of farmer knowledge on welfare-friendly techniques.\nOur baseline data confirmed an urgent need for targeted interventions to improve fish welfare, reduce mortality rates, and enhance farm productivity. This evidence underpins our project design and validates the direct-to-farmer, cluster-based model as a timely and necessary solution to transform welfare practices in Nigerian aquaculture.\n\nOur Innovative Approach\niCareFish’s farmer-centered model builds fish welfare from the ground up by:\n•\tEstablishing trust with farmers\n•\tDelivering culturally tailored, hands-on training\n•\tProviding ongoing follow-up support\nThis ensures that knowledge doesn’t just get taught—it gets adopted and sustained. The program works through clusters of farms in Delta, Edo, Kwara, and Lagos States, leveraging existing networks for effective and scalable impact.\n\n2025–26 SMART Goal (Pilot Phase)\nBy June 2026, iCareFish will:\n•\tDeliver its engagement model in 5 aquaculture clusters\n•\tTrain 400+ fish farmers in welfare-aligned practices such as humane slaughter, enrichment, oxygenation, and improved feeding protocols\n•\tAchieve ≥ 60% of farmers showing improved knowledge\n•\tAchieve ≥ 40% adoption of at least one measurable welfare improvement, validated through observation and farmer reporting\n\n2028 North Star Metric (Vision)\nBy 2028, iCareFish aims to:\n•\tReach 15+ farm clusters\n•\tEnable at least 40% of trained farmers to sustain three or more fish-friendly practices for 6 months or longer through follow-up visits and farmer-led reporting\n•\tKey practices include humane slaughter, reduced crowding, habitat enrichment, improved oxygenation, and controlled feeding/fasting to avoid suffering\n\nEvidence and Learning\nOur approach prioritizes trust and learning over compliance, using:\n•\tPre/post training assessments\n•\tOn-farm follow-ups at 3 and 6 months\n•\tQuarterly learning sessions with farmers and staff\n\nWhy This Model Is Different\nUnlike prior awareness campaigns relying on virtual outreach or one-off trainings, iCareFish delivers a hands-on, cluster-based model engaging farmers regularly through trusted local facilitators embedded in their communities. This approach fosters sustained behavior change by empowering farmers as active agents of welfare improvement, supported by continuous follow-up and practical problem-solving tailored to their specific challenges.\nLocal facilitators are selected for their cultural fit and knowledge of community dynamics, and trained to deliver tailored, practical welfare support. This trusted, embedded model ensures adoption and sustainability beyond the project’s life.\n\nEnvironmental and Biodiversity Impact\nImproving fish welfare contributes to healthier aquaculture ecosystems by reducing stress-related disease outbreaks, minimizing the need for harmful chemical treatments, and lessening negative impacts on surrounding biodiversity from poorly managed farms. Healthier farms mean healthier watersheds and support for local aquatic biodiversity, aligning with broader conservation goals.\n\nFunding Need (2025–26 Pilot)\nWith funding, iCareFish will:\n•\tLaunch its model in 5 clusters using trusted local facilitators\n•\tEquip teams with feedback-driven monitoring tools to track adoption and barriers\n•\tGenerate robust, field-tested evidence of behavior change essential for national scale-up\nThis is a rare opportunity to influence fish welfare norms across Nigeria and West Africa, preventing low-welfare practices from becoming entrenched as the sector grows.\n\nTheory of Change (ToC) Summary\n•\tInputs: Funding, local facilitators, training materials, monitoring tools\n•\tActivities: Cluster-based training workshops, direct farm visits, behavior change support, ongoing monitoring\n•\tOutputs: Trained farmers, improved knowledge, adoption of welfare practices\n•\tOutcomes: Reduced fish mortality, improved fish welfare, enhanced farmer livelihoods\n•\tImpact: Scalable, sustainable shift toward humane aquaculture practices in Nigeria and beyond',

      'Continue leading a national campaign to pass the End Kidney Deaths Act (H.R. 2687), a bill projected to save 100,000 lives and $37B in taxpayer costs over the next decade.',
    projectDescription:
      'Six years ago, my son and I each donated a kidney to a stranger. We knew it would change our recipients’ lives. We did not realize it would transform ours. That experience ignited my mission: to fight for the 90,000 Americans on the kidney waitlist, half of whom will die before receiving one. This is a crisis we can actually solve.\nThe End Kidney Deaths Act (H.R. 2687) will save up to 100,000 lives in the next decade, end the needless suffering of thousands of families, and save taxpayers $37 billion. We are closer than ever to passing it, but the window will not stay open forever.\nThis bipartisan, ten-year pilot program provides a refundable tax credit of $10,000 annually for five years ($50,000 total) to living kidney donors who give to a stranger who has been waiting the longest. These “non-directed” donations often trigger kidney transplant chains that can help a multitude of patients from a single act of generosity. Living donor kidneys last roughly twice as long as deceased donor kidneys and deliver far better outcomes for patients.\nIn 2024, with ACX’s $50,000 support, we achieved unprecedented momentum. We secured 18 congressional cosponsors, helped publish op-eds in key districts, and launched a national campaign supported by kidney donors, recipients, advocates, and leading transplant professionals. We organized the first-ever lobby day for the End Kidney Deaths Act, bringing donors and patients to Washington to share their stories directly with lawmakers. We delivered policy briefs to all 435 House offices and 100 Senate offices and kept an active dialogue with staff.\nIn 2025, that groundwork paid off. We now have 29 cosponsors, over 100 media stories, and the support of 39 organizations across the country.\nWith ACX’s continued investment, we can accelerate to the legislative finish line by:\n\n*Expanding our grassroots advocacy network by recruiting and training more donors, recipients, and families to speak directly to Congress.\n\n*Scaling our media presence with op-eds, national TV and radio interviews, and high-impact donor-recipient stories.\n\n*Organizing a second Lobby Day and Congressional briefing in Washington, DC, in October of 2025 to maintain coordinated pressure from diverse constituents.\n\n*Deploying targeted district campaigns in swing states and committee leadership areas, using both in-person and digital strategies.\n\n*Engaging the transplant community by partnering with surgeons, nephrologists, and patient advocates to amplify urgency.\n\nThe kidney crisis is a slow-moving mass casualty event. Every year, about 10,000 Americans on the waitlist die from kidney failure, deaths that are entirely preventable. Today, 800,000 Americans live with kidney failure, a number projected to exceed one million by 2030. Dialysis, the alternative to a transplant, is debilitating and costs the federal government over $50 billion annually, about 1% of the entire federal budget. Kidney transplants not only save lives but also reduce these costs dramatically.\nCongress already uses the tax code to encourage prosocial behavior, from adoption to home buying to renewable energy. Compensating living kidney donors is both morally urgent and fiscally responsible. Even the lead sponsor of the National Organ Transplant Act said 41 years ago that if voluntary donation could not meet demand, tax credits should be implemented. That time has come.\nPassing the End Kidney Deaths Act is not just policy. It is a lifeline for tens of thousands of Americans who would otherwise die waiting. With ACX’s help, we can build a coalition broad and determined enough to overcome partisan inertia and secure passage before the end of the current Congress in December 2026.\nWe have the policy. We have the people. We have the momentum. Now we must get to the legislative finish line and save lives on a historic scale.\n',

      'I am uniquely positioned to lead this work because I have lived both the personal and professional sides of the kidney crisis. Six years ago, my son and I each donated a kidney to a stranger. Since then, I have been a volunteer mentor for prospective donors, led workshops on eating healthy for kidney disease patients and been an advocate for the National Kidney Foundation, The National Kidney Donation Organization, Waitlist Zero and the Coalition to Modify NOTA. These experiences gave me firsthand insight into the barriers that prevent more people from becoming living donors  and the life-changing impact for those who receive them. It also instilled the determination that now drives my full-time advocacy to end the kidney shortage.\nI have spent over three decades as an educator, communicator, and organizer, including six years as a Columbia University professor and program director. My professional background includes leading high-profile campaigns, writing for publications, and engaging effectively with diverse stakeholders. I have applied these skills to build this citizen-led effort to address the kidney crisis through legislation.\nSince launching the campaign for the End Kidney Deaths Act, I have:\n\n*Built bipartisan momentum in Congress, securing 29 cosponsors, with active engagement from members across the political spectrum.\n\n*Coordinated national media coverage resulting in over 100 news stories, op-eds, and interviews in outlets including USA Today, The Hill, The Baltimore Sun, and the Los Angeles Times.\n\n*Led the first-ever lobby day for the bill, bringing living donors, recipients, and families to Washington to share personal stories directly with lawmakers, creating lasting relationships with key offices.\n\n*Maintained ongoing outreach to all 535 congressional offices by providing tailored policy briefs and following up with targeted district and committee-level campaigns.\n\n*Built alliances with 39 organizations in the kidney and transplant space, including patient advocacy groups, medical professionals, and donor networks.\n\n*Designed high-impact public campaigns including social media videos, public events, and on-the-ground actions that have mobilized both grassroots supporters and influential voices.\n\nIn 2024, ACX’s $50,000 grant allowed me to scale the campaign from a small, donor-driven effort into a coordinated national push. We grew our coalition, sharpened our message, and positioned the End Kidney Deaths Act as one of the most promising and fiscally responsible solutions to a major public health crisis.\nI am deeply familiar with both the legislative process and the human realities behind the statistics. My work has brought me into direct contact with patients on dialysis, families losing loved ones on the waitlist, and the surgeons and nephrologists who see these tragedies every day. I understand that ending the kidney shortage will take more than compassion. It requires sustained advocacy, bipartisan strategy, and the ability to translate policy into plain, compelling language that moves people to act.\nIn addition to my own lived experience and organizing work, I have developed strong working relationships with congressional staff and advocacy networks that can be activated quickly as the bill progresses. I have also collaborated with nationally recognized transplant experts, including Dr. John Roberts of UCSF and Professor Al Roth of Stanford U, to ensure that our messaging is scientifically accurate and medically sound.\nThe fight to pass the End Kidney Deaths Act is not theoretical for me. It is personal. I know the difference a single kidney can make because I have seen it in the lives of recipients. I also know the scale of what is possible: the bill could prevent up to 100,000 deaths in the next decade and save taxpayers $37 billion.\nI bring a combination of lived experience, proven advocacy success, bipartisan trust, media skill, and an existing national infrastructure that makes me qualified to lead this campaign to victory. ACX’s continued investment will not just sustain the work. It will maximize the impact of a proven strategy that is already delivering measurable results and poised for a breakthrough.\n',

    projectDescription:
      'For many years, care for HIV and TB in Africa has been siloed into very specific, high-quality programs designed to find people who are infected and get them treated. PEPFAR did incredible work using this model over the past few decades, but this was quite expensive and very vulnerable to outside shocks (like someone coming in with a metaphorical chainsaw to stop payments to U.S. foreign aid.) After the foreign aid freeze back in January and the significant cuts to various aid programs caused a lot of chaos in the delivery of HIV/TB services, our hospital in rural Kenya decided that the way forward was to integrate our HIV/TB clinic with our other medical clinics to remove these silos to preserve as much of our quality of care as possible despite these outside shocks. This was always part of the long-term plan, but it became a much more immediate concern with all of our HIV/TB funding threatened and forced us to work much faster on making it happen.\n\nWhile PEPFAR funding looks relatively safe for now, the question of long-term sustainability for HIV/TB care is still a big one. Donor funds (including U.S. foreign aid) is probably going to be available for antiretroviral drugs for HIV for quite a while, but all of the other things that help people get those drugs (like training doctors and other providers in how to prescribe and manage these patients, community health workers to follow up on patients who have disappeared, etc.) need funding. There’s very little money for other primary care and chronic disease management in Africa, which means that hospitals and clinics are going to have to be really strategic in how they integrate their outpatient medical services. Because of the way that money flows, HIV patients have been getting really good services for many years and other medical outpatients have been getting practically nothing. Integrating the two means meeting somewhere in the middle.\n\nThere are lots of different factors to consider as this integration proceeds, but the biggest area we’ve identified where people could improve is in training our medical clinicians. They’ve always been managing conditions like hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, etc., but now they need to know how to manage HIV (which is usually at least a 3-week course) and funding community health workers to help manage both HIV and medical conditions in the community. With lots of hospitals and clinics across the continent asking how they can integrate these services, we want to demonstrate just how valuable community health services are in managing these conditions and set up a model for how integration should proceed. We also want to help set the tone for debates about the future of foreign aid and what kinds of integrated processes should be supported going forward. A lot of this is about proving to hospital administrators that they should invest in community health work because it brings dividends to their patients that ultimately benefit the community and proving to donors that integrated primary care is a sustainable future for HIV and TB care. This includes, we hope, skeptical politicians who are currently suspicious about the value of foreign aid and want to see an “exit ramp,” so that they’re not committed to just shoveling money at a problem indefinitely.\n',

      'Continue documenting the indigenous use of native Psilocybe mushrooms in Lesotho, including the collection of physical samples, to identify novel medical applications of psilocybin.',
    projectDescription: 'TBD',
    // 'In 2023, a paper in Mycologia documented two new native species of Psilocybe mushrooms in Southern Africa. But the more striking report in this paper was the apparent long-term use of these mushrooms by traditional healers in Lesotho. Despite common assumptions that psilocybin has been used all over the world for thousands of years, no actual evidence of indigenous use had been documented outside of the Americas — that is, use preceding the magic mushroom craze triggered by Gordon Wasson’s 1957 article in Life. The data from Lesotho constituted the first known case. However, it consisted of only one paragraph, with the main information acquired by happenstance during interviews meant to document the general uses of fungi by Basotho healers. \n\nI learned of these reports during the first year of my PhD in Evolutionary Anthropology at UC Davis, and decided to travel to Lesotho during the summer of 2025 to begin the systematic data collection on psilocybin use in Lesotho. For these interviews, I collaborated with Betsy Sethathi. Betsy is a trained traditional healer; she contributed the initial report to the Mycologia paper. \n\nBetsy and I interviewed~30 healers during this first round of fieldwork about their uses of psilocybin. We received independently verified reports of several applications that, to our knowledge, have no recorded counterparts elsewhere in the world. These included (but were not limited to) the following:\n\n• Mixture into a bubbling foam, which is consumed several times a day by healers-in-training to bolster creativity.\n• Powdered and rubbed into external wounds to speed up healing.\n• Infused into brews, mixed into porridges or snuffed to heal a variety of mental illnesses, including epilepsy, depression, and anxiety.\n\nOur pilot data is of extreme anthropological importance. The cross-cultural record of hallucinogen use has to this point contained virtually zero data on Africa, save the use of iboga. Our interviews suggest that Southern Africa belongs in this global story as well. \n\nBut the key significance of this project is clinical. The medical rung of the modern psychedelic movement has been heavily influenced by the documented uses of psilocybin in Central America. The structure of psychedelic therapy — in which a guide helps a patient move through the altered state of consciousness triggered by a large dose of the compound — emerged from and continually refers to ceremonies conducted among the Mazatec Indians. \n\nYet the medical uses we’ve encountered are completely different from those that have determined the path of the Western psychedelic renaissance. Basotho healers employ a form of micro-dosing during initiation to enhance the spiritual creativity of trainees; they prescribe small amounts of the mushroom to cure mental illnesses over the course of weeks or months; and they even use it to treat wounds and other external ailments. Notably, they also incorporate other plants into these treatments. The independent effects of these plants have rarely been examined, and unsurprisingly, their effects when stacked alongside psilocybin have never been studied. \n\nJust as our ethnographic understanding of psilocybin use in Central America has informed how we employ macrodoses of psilocybin in Western medicine, the ethnographic understanding of psilocybin use in Lesotho can inform how we employ other medical applications of psilocybin. The crucial next step in our fieldwork is to move beyond interviews toward (A) direct observation of psilocybin use by healers and, most importantly, (B) the collection of physical samples of the powders, snuffs, brews and other psilocybin-infused mixtures they employ.\n\nBecause my initial fieldwork was conducted outside Lesotho’s mushroom season, I was unable to collect physical samples. To continue my research, I therefore need to return during the rainy season (January-March). Examining the clinical applications of Basotho knowledge will not be possible unless that data is collected. I therefore hope to return to Lesotho starting in January. Betsy and I will reconvene with contacts in two highland areas of Lesotho, Butha Buthe and Semonkong, where we will then be able to acquire physical samples and observational data. These samples will be stored and delivered to collaborators at the University of Pretoria and the University of Stellenbosch for biochemical analysis, after which follow-up work on possible clinical applications can proceed. \n\nNotably, this indigenous knowledge is likely to dwindle and eventually vanish in the coming years. The Lesotho highlands are subject to an influx of tourism, monetization, and Christian missionary influence; in many other places, this combination has tended to push indigenous groups away from their traditional medicines. Unless systematic fieldwork is carried out soon, then, it is possible that the opportunity to study the Basotho uses of psilocybin — and their clinical implications — will soon be lost. ',
    backgroundQualifications: 'TBD',
    // 'To the best of my knowledge, my collaborator and I are the only two researchers to have investigated and recorded indigenous uses of psilocybin in Africa, and also the only researchers to have acquired such data anywhere outside the Americas. Having conducted our initial round of fieldwork, we are also uniquely positioned to continue it and ultimately acquire physical samples of the psilocybin medicines employed by healers. Betsy, my collaborator, is extremely well-connected to networks of healers across Southern Africa, speaks four Bantu dialects fluently, and is highly knowledgeable about healing practices from her own training and twenty years of active practice. Through her skillset and connections, we now have established relationships and contacts with dozens of Basotho healers across Lesotho, most of whom have agreed to follow-up visits and expressed willingness to share physical samples. \n\nI cannot overstate how difficult it often is for Western scientists to build trust with traditional healers: they are understandably concerned about extractive anthropology, legal repercussions, and payment for sharing hard-earned sacred knowledge. By collaborating with Betsy, though, I was able to build that trust — these healers now understand our motives and feel they can rely on us to treat them and their practices with respect. I am certain that no one else in the world is as prepared as we are to take the next step in these relationships by collecting direct observational data and physical samples. \n\nExamining the clinical implications of these medicines will also require the assistance of experts in a variety of other fields, particularly ethnopharmacology and clinical psychiatry. To that end, I am collaborating with several researchers around South Africa and the United States in preparation for follow-up studies.  On the ethnopharmacological side, I am working with members of the Southern Center for Indigenous Psycho-Pharma (SCIPP) who have agreed to assist with analyzing physical samples for their alkaloid contents, potential stacking effects, and other crucial tests for exploring possible medical applications. My SCIP collaborators include Gary Stafford, an expert ethnobotanist who has documented over 300 new species of plants used in indigenous African medicine, and Breyten van Der Merwe, the world expert on South African psilocybe mushrooms. Breyten and I also plan to conduct DNA analysis of ancient Bantu snuff boxes, animal horns and other containers to test for remnants of psilocybe. Such tests have never been conducted  — if successful, they would constitute the first definitive traces of psilocybin use in the archaeological record. \n\nOn the psychiatric side: my home university of UC Davis contains the Institute for Psychedelics and Neurotherapeutics, one of the few research centers in the world dedicated to psychedelic medicine. Their research focuses on therapeutic uses of psychedelics that do not involve major hallucinogenic effects — this is, by far, the most common kind of psilocybin use among Basotho healers. If I am successful in collecting physical samples, I thus also plan to collaborate with the Center to investigate novel applications of psilocybin based on the practices of Basotho healers. Of special interest here are the effects that may arise from stacking other compounds alongside psilocybin, as is common practice in Lesotho. \n\nI am currently starting the second year of my PhD program, which gives me the necessary time and openness in my research program to carry out these studies over the next several years; the freedom to conduct long-term fieldwork is much harder to come by once you leave graduate school. After completing surveys in Lesotho, I hope to conduct similar studies in other areas of Africa where psilocybe mushrooms commonly grow. One central example is Tanzania, where rock art appears to depict the ritualistic use of mushrooms; there have also been anecdotal (though not yet investigated) reports of psilocybin use by Sandawe groups in Kondoa. Given that knowledge of psilocybin use in Lesotho remained unknown until 2023, despite the widespread distribution and use of the mushrooms, it is entirely possible that applications in other understudied regions of Africa have been overlooked as well.\n\nReferences:\nDr. Manvir Singh — mvrsingh@ucdavis.edu\nDr. Gary Stafford — gary.stafford@up.ac.za\nBreyten van Der Merwe — 22623442@sun.ac.za',

Meanwhile, thousands of scientists and machine learning engineers are locked out of discovery.\n\n#Covalent’s solution\nCovalent is building a centralized, AI-powered metadata engine—one that automatically ingests, standardizes, and continuously updates metadata across all public biological datasets. This system turns every public dataset into a findable, trustworthy, machine-readable resource from the moment it is published.\nNow imagine this for every public dataset in existence. Scientists could find relevant studies in seconds using natural language. Flawed metadata would be automatically flagged. Machine learning models could train on integrated datasets spanning multiple modalities. Discovery itself would accelerate, raising all boats.\n\n#A market starving of ML training data\nCovalent has conducted a comprehensive market research covering nearly 200 model-building companies/groups. Below is a very brief summary of only one of the identified market clusters.\n📁Transcriptomics (Gene Expression)\nTechnology: bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing.\nPreprocessing: map RNA-seq reads to transcriptome, quantify gene counts or TPM, normalize across samples (e.g. combat for batch effects, log-transform).\nGroups & models:\n- Lantern Pharma’s RADR\n- BenevolentAI\n- Scailyte’s disease pattern finder & Immunai’s immune AI\n\nWhat becomes apparent is that the same preprocessing tasks serve multiple groups across industry and academia. This redundancy means Covalent can add huge value: rather than each group reinventing the wheel, a specialized pipeline can do it once and serve many.\n\n\n#Making biology predictable: gradually, then suddenly\nOur technical vision enables a disruptive go-to-market strategy that is designed to create differentiated, high-value intellectual property at every stage.\n\n1️⃣The metadata layer\nCovalent’s immediate focus is on standardizing and enriching the metadata of the entire NCBI's SRA and GEO. This is a technically tractable, capital-efficient, and high-leverage starting point. \nDelivery: 3 months\nTarget customers: 3rd party platforms (e.g., NASA GeneLab, Kepler AI, FutureHouse, Mantle Bio, Benchling, Latch.bio, Rancho, Elucidata, BioTuring, Synthesize.bio)\nRevenue potential: small ($50k-$100k) \n\n2️⃣The provider of ML training data\nCovalent’s enriched, standardized metadata allows instant dataset discovery. Our primary commercial focus is the \"virtual cell\" opportunity. \nDelivery: 6 months\nTarget customers: Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative and Arc Institute. Also, companies like Insilico Medicine, Owkin, CytoReason, and Recursion selling decision-support systems to pharma R&D.\nRevenue potential: medium ($500k-$5M) \n\n3️⃣The model builder\nThe unparalleled datasets assembled through Covalent’s public pipeline will become a unique asset for training their own proprietary machine learning models. By moving up the value chain from data provider to insight generator, Covalent will address critical challenges in drug discovery. \nDelivery: 24 months\nTarget customers: big pharma and large biotechs running drug development pipelines (e.g., Shift Biosciences)\nRevenue potential: medium ($1M-$20M) \n\n4️⃣CovalentTx\nDelivery: 3-5 years\nRevenue potential: large ($100M-$1B)\n\n\n",

      "#About Nicholas Schaum\nMy work is driven by a single goal: to keep as many people as possible healthy for as long as possible. Fifteen years ago, I began by dissecting individual molecular pathways in ageing biology, hoping to prevent disease onset. But I soon realized that generating community‑wide resources would amplify impact far more. That led me to convene over 100 researchers to build Tabula Muris Senis, the first organism‑wide, single‑cell atlas of ageing, in partnership with the CZ Biohub.\n\nI then co‑founded Rejuvenome, a $70 million proto-FRO mapping how rejuvenation strategies affect the ageing process across the body. From scratch, we assembled a dedicated team of twelve, designed a seven‑year roadmap, and processed tens of thousands of samples in our first year alone.\n\nWhen Rejuvenome was abruptly halted, I stepped back and recognized a deeper bottleneck: data generation now outstrips our ability to organize and interpret it. At a FutureHouse workshop, I realized that machine learning could bridge that gap—so long as we first make every dataset machine‑ready. Today, my mission is to build that foundation: an AI‑driven platform that transforms fragmented biological data into a unified resource, empowering researchers everywhere to accelerate discovery and improve human health.\n\n\n#About Jorge Bastos\nI bring a unique blend of technical expertise and strategic product leadership. For over two decades, I’ve led the development of software and data products that empower people—from children learning maths to families managing debt. At TotallyMoney, I joined pre-launch and helped grow the platform to over 5 million users. I built the first machine learning model for credit card eligibility, transforming how people managed their finances. More importantly, it made a real difference—helping people under financial stress make better decisions. I'm now applying that same mission-driven approach to the biosciences: building infrastructure that empowers both human and AI scientists.\n\nCovalent.bio, co-founded with Nick Schaum, is my response to a core bottleneck in biology: AI can't fulfill its promise until biological data is clean, discoverable, and machine-readable. The ultimate aim is to make biology predictable—enabling simulated interventions, faster drug discovery, and the precise design of biological systems.\n\nCovalent is designed to be an open, enduring public-good infrastructure with a sustainable path to scale. We are at an inflection point in biology. With the right infrastructure, we can unlock a Cambrian explosion of discovery. Covalent is designed to be that foundation. And I am committed—intellectually, emotionally, and professionally—to seeing it through.",

    projectDescription:
      'Coauthored by JD Bauman (christiansforimpact.org ) and Nick Brown (Effct.org)\n\nChristians are called to serve, to love their neighbor, and to care for the poor, the marginalized, and the vulnerable. This ethic of service and sacrificial love has deep overlap with the aims of the Effective Altruism movement: to do the most good with our time, careers, and resources. Christians for Impact (CFI) exists to make that connection more visible and actionable for Christians who want to live lives of high-impact purpose in service to Christ.\n\nCFI offers a wide range of high-leverage initiatives, including:\n- Two annual 150+ person conferences for Christian professionals, recently featuring the Archbishop of Canterbury\n- 100+ annual 1-on-1 Career advisings \n- A website on careers, a website and blog on EA and Christianity, altogether averaging together 120,000+ yearly visitors \n- A curated impact job board \n- A “Which Problem Should I Solve?” quiz to help individuals discern their calling\n-- A monthly newsletter\n- Consistently strong social media content and community engagement\n\nWe believe that these initiatives are exactly what the moment calls for — and that with the right digital strategy, they can scale to reach thousands more high-potential Christians.\nEffct.org is a great fit for a digital partnership to help CFI harness the power of paid advertising and data-driven experimentation. \n\nOur goal is to:\n-Grow CFI’s newsletter and quiz completions\n-Drive engagement with 1-on-1 EA-informed coaching, resources, and job opportunities\n-Convert organic social engagement into deeper relationships and applications\n-Identify and scale what’s working, drop what isn’t, and iterate using an EA-style lens of cost-effectiveness\n\nThis project is modeled after our successful work with Consultants for Impact, a similarly aligned organization. That campaign produced results that exceeded expectations by a factor of 9. \n\nWe’ve provided statistics for it in the “Why we’re qualified” section.\n\nOur scope for CFI would include:\n\n-Strategy and goal-setting with CFI’s leadership\n-Creation of compelling creative assets that resonate with Christian professionals\n-Paid advertising campaigns across Meta, LinkedIn, and other platforms\n-List-building, email sequences, and lead nurturing\n-Transparent reporting and continuous iteration based on EA-style evaluation metrics\n\nWith ACXG funding, we will empower CFI to grow their reach, improve their impact per dollar, and help more Christians live out their faith in high-impact, evidence-informed ways. This is not just about more impressions,  it’s about helping people make career decisions that align with the greatest needs in the world and the greatest calling on their lives. These impact areas, articulated at christiansforimpact.org/summary , are well aligned with ACXG’s priorities.',

      "Christians for Impact is already doing the hard and important work of helping believers connect their faith with global problems worth solving. What we need now is scale. We've talked to EA marketing consultants and worked with a few in the past, interviewed career advising orgs with similar needs, and isolated marketers skilled at tackled our bottlenecks. That’s where Effct.org comes in.\n\nEffct.org is a full-stack digital marketing agency that specializes in campaigns that drive measurable behavior change. We’ve run millions of dollars in paid ads and know what works and what doesn’t — not just in theory, but in real-world campaigns with tight budgets and high stakes. Our work spans strategy, execution, and analysis. We don’t just make things look good — we make them perform.\n\nWe were founded eight years ago to serve the Effective Altruism space. Our very first client was GiveWell. But at the time, there was little appetite for paid digital marketing in EA, so we expanded our work to support high-impact organizations across government, public health, and education. Today, we work with five counties in Colorado — including Eagle and Pitkin, home to Vail and Aspen.\n\nOne example: in Summit County, our multi-year anti-vaping campaign helped contribute to a stunning 71% decrease in teen vaping over the duration of our work. That campaign was rooted in message testing, micro-targeted ad placements, and EA-style iteration to move metrics that matter.\n\nWe’ve brought the same rigor to values-aligned nonprofits like Consultants for Impact (CFI), where we recently completed a digital engagement campaign that achieved results that were 9x higher than expectations. \n\nSome highlights:\n-11.8M Meta impressions (vs. 2M goal)\n-7,000+ new newsletter signups\n-66% increase in website visitors\n-214 career advising applications in Q2 alone — nearly matching their total for all of 2024\n\nWe at Effct.org see a similar opportunity with Christians for Impact. They have a compelling mission, strong infrastructure, and early traction. We have the tools to take that to the next level. Our team of six brings nearly 30 years of combined digital marketing experience — and we approach every project with the discipline of high-leverage experimentation, clear KPIs, and relentless focus on what works.\n\nNick Brown, Effct.org’s founder and CEO, is a committed Christian and a Deacon at his local Presbyterian church. He’s also a longtime EA participant and ACX reader. He believes in the mission of Christians for Impact and sees this as a chance to help bridge the gap between two powerful moral traditions — using digital tools to serve Christ and maximize global impact.\n\nReferences:\nSarah Pomeranz, CEO at Consultants for Impact, sarah@consultantsforimpact.org\nBecky Peltier, Public Health at Summit County, CO, Becky.Peltier@summitcountyco.gov \n",

      'Continue developing ‘copy-paste-detective’ - a software that detects signs of data fabrication in scientific research - and run it against 20,000 publicly available Excel datasets.',
    projectDescription:
      'Some unknown fraction of published research is based on fabricated data. It’s impossible to estimate how widespread the problem is, but there are some troubling indications, such as this paper by Bik et al (https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.00809-16) which showed that 4% of papers with Western blots contained duplicated images. Notably, that study was conducted by the authors in their own free time, which points to a larger issue: There is very little funding available for detecting fraud. That’s unfortunate since fraud imposes such big social costs, both by squandering grant funding that could have been awarded to legitimate researchers and by polluting the scientific literature with fake results.\n\nTo tackle the issue of data fabrication, I\'m building \'copy-paste-detective\': https://github.com/markusenglund/copy-paste-detective. It’s inspired by two cases of data fabrication that made the news in recent years. One by Nobel prize winner Thomas Südhof (https://forbetterscience.com/2023/10/04/thomas-sudhof-and-the-standards-of-scientific-rigor/) and one by spider ecologist Jonathan Pruitt (https://laskowskilab.faculty.ucdavis.edu/2020/01/29/retractions/). Both cases had publicly available datasets with entire blocks of copy-pasted data - the most easy-to-detect type of fraud imaginable. My idea was to write a software that could identify these data anomalies and then run it on randomly selected datasets to see what would turn up.\n\nI have now analyzed 92 recently published spreadsheets from Dryad (a repository of research data) using the software. Here are its first results, all discovered and reported by me (username: Campanula hypopolia) on Pubpeer, a public forum for post-publication peer review: \n\n- https://pubpeer.com/publications/84805DBB9C70E24E7E6C4A80F60A43 - "Drought decreases carbon flux..." by Ge et al.\nSurprisingly the authors agreed to publish the original lab data after receiving pressure from the journal editor, which I could then use as evidence against them. A retraction seems inevitable.\n\n- https://pubpeer.com/publications/1FF86EEED4054ECA9E7625F67F79FB - "Dual drivers of plant invasions..." by Wang et al.\nThe authors are issuing a corrigendum while providing no explanation for the incriminating patterns in their data.\n\n- https://pubpeer.com/publications/103D04A8BB1CC08C6F1364C92CE85E - "Extreme Warming Coordinately Shifts Root and Leaf Traits..." by Zhang et al.\nThe senior author is issuing a corrigendum while insisting that no deliberate fabrication took place.\n\n\nIn addition, I’ve found two more similar cases that I have not reported on Pubpeer yet.\n\nFinding so much fabricated data in a random sample of only 92 papers was surprising to say the least. The best explanation for why it’s so easy to find is that no one else is looking for it. There is after all basically zero funding available for combatting research fraud. This neglect has created an opportunity for my project to have an outsized positive impact since there’s so much low-hanging fruit that nobody else is picking up.\n\nI now have direct line-of-sight towards finding ~1000 cases of never-before-seen data fraud this year.\n\nTo achieve this goal, I would need to analyze all of the 20.000 articles available on Dryad that fit my inclusion criteria - this wouldn’t require any new code, but a lot of time spent on analysis. If it turns out that the entire repository has an equally high rate of data anomalies as the first batch - around 5% of all papers - that would translate to 1000 cases. At 2 hours of manual analysis per positive match + 1 hour spent on writing Pubpeer comments and emails, this will take around 3000 hours. It’s clear that the manual workload will limit the number of cases that I can process, so I will explore the possibility of getting help from volunteers.\n\nThat’s just the beginning. There are many other repositories of scientific Excel data (Zenodo, OSF etc) that I will write integrations for. Based on my first results, I’ve also identified some promising new strategies for finding more fraud:\n\n1) Programmatically identify cells that are near-perfect duplicates, but with a single tweaked digit. When manually inspecting the data, I’ve discovered this issue in every single one (!) of the 5 cases of likely fraud I’ve investigated. Fraudsters love, and I mean love changing a single digit of a number they’ve just copy-pasted.\n\n2) Create an algorithm that asks an LLM if any column has a mathematical relationship with other columns, then checks if the mathematical relationship holds for all values in the column. I have seen two cases so far where the researchers fabricated one of the columns but forgot to make the other columns consistent with the fabrication.\n\nThis will be a lot of work, and I won’t be able to accomplish all of it while working a demanding full-time job. I’m asking for $50,000 which would allow me to quit my job as a Lead backend engineer and focus all my time on sleuthing.\n',

      'I have over 8 years of experience as a software engineer. I currently work as a Lead backend engineer at a Dutch publisher of sports magazines where I lead projects to build new features and onboard new magazines onto our platform. That\'s important, because a common theme in previous successful anti-fraud efforts is the creators have built software that could scale up to the millions of articles that have been published.\n\nTo make the program work, I have among other things needed to build an algorithm for scoring the suspiciousness of duplicate sequences that takes fractions and floating point inaccuracies into account. I’ve needed to use LLMs to work out which columns should be analyzed. I\'ve written a large suite of automated tests to prevent regressions etc etc. The fact that I’ve managed to build a system that finds real results is evidence that I’m the best person to lead it to the next stage. \n\nI have also shown the persistence needed to analyze each case of anomalous data, while still giving the authors a fair shake. I did the painstaking work of reconstructing the spreadsheet and recreate the graphs based on the raw lab data on the "Ge et al" paper, thereby proving the case against the author. While that level of effort is not sustainable to do for all articles, it proves that I have the grit necessary to do the work, even when it’s tedious.\n\nFinally, I have experience leading teams at my job, which will become important in the future as the project starts to leverage contributors from the scientific community to help with the laborious hand analysis.',

This makes sense because without traders, markets are no good. However, prediction markets have a second, much larger 'lurker' audience that I believe is underserved by the major platforms. As prediction markets become more useful, I believe the ways in which non-bettors consume them should keep up.\n\nSome of what I am proposing are improvements and enhancements to my existing projects in this space. They include:\n- WHEN (https://when.val.run) — a live timeline of when everything's going to happen, according to Manifold date markets.\n- @manifoldmaven (https://x.com/manifoldmaven) — a Twitter bot that tweets big 24h moves on popular manifold markets.\n\nI have broken my project proposal into three levels of ambition, each building on the last. \n\nI. Ambition level 1:\n   A. Improvements to \"WHEN\", my future timeline of everything that is going to happen, according to Manifold Markets Date markets.\n      i. Allow users to filter the timeline by Topic, Number of Traders, Liquidity\n      ii. Performance and design improvements\n      iii. Exploring integrations with non-Manifold providers\n      iv. Start adding information from non-date markets to the timeline:\n          a. ex: on known future Fed Meeting dates, add an event that says Fed Cuts Rates X%, where X is the current predicted rate cut\n   B. Improvements to @manifoldmaven, my Twitter bot that tweets every time a popular Manifold market moves by a large margin in 24 hours.\n      i. Polymarket and Kalshi support\n      ii. optimize Tweet format based on feedback from superfans/powerusers\n      iii. add email alerts or other types of digests.\n      iv. speed improvements and migration from Firebase to val.town for much faster iteration speeds\n      v. smarter market selection and collapsing multiple market updates into replies\n   C. New Projects:\n      i. Countdown: simply paste a manifold date market url to the end of this url and it will automatically generate a live countdown page for that market's estimated date.\n      ii. A semi-automated newsletter that packages important prediction probabilities into useful insights.\n   D. Marketing\n      i. Funny, slick social media/LinkedIn Posts/Videos about I'm working on.\n\nII. Ambition Level 2:\n   A. Everything from level 1 plus:\n   B. Enhancing 'The Rundown' (https://therundown.val.run/) (my prototype of a user-generated prediction market dashboard)\n      i. Making it so that users can easily create their own prediction market dashboards with this tool\n   C. A consistent, dedicated content strategy\n      i. A dedicated monthly newsletter for at least one year.\n      ii. Ongoing social media/Youtube video updates of projects and their progress\n      iii. Outreach to podcasts in order to discuss these projects\n   D. Additional WHEN Timeline work:\n      i. allow for the creation of markets on the timeline (via a link to Manifold)\n      ii. Start maintaining dedicated timelines for important events\n      iii. Branch into non-timeline pages for important events\n      iv. Make it possible for people to add things to the timeline (by creating a Manifold Market)\n\nIII. Ambition level 3:\n   A. everything from levels 1 and 2\n   B. incorporate prediction market tools into my social building site (build.moi/@dcm31 (beta))\n      i. build.moi is a project I made that is meant to be TikTok for your vibe-coded creations\n      ii. I will incorporate user-generated prediction markets and dashboards into the build.moi feed\n      iii. The big goal here is to make important prediction market content swipeable, snackable, and hackable, so that anyone can build on top of it.\n      iv. Mana economy\n          1. make it so that users of build.moi can spend and charge manifold mana for services created by other build.moi users.\n          2. mana will cycle in and out of both prediction markets and users' wallets, as they reward each other for software, services, funny comments, etc.\n   C. Updates to WHEN\n      i. Automated timeline management\n          1. auto-creation and management of important date markets\n          2. Agents that automatically bet on the date markets based on the latest news.\n   D. I haven't contacted them about this, but to the extent that it is logical, I would be open to building some of these things directly into Manifold as a sort of ACX-sponsored fellowship.\n",

    projectDescription:
      'Good Ancestors advocates for Australian-specific policies aimed at solving this century’s most challenging problems. Currently, we focus about 80% of our efforts on AI safety. Our theory of change involves identifying opportunities for significant impact, a “policy window” (conditions that make change possible), and an angle for us to contribute.\n\nWhen we identify an opportunity, we take a coordinated approach to create the best chance of change:\n\n(1) We review research and proposals and adapt them to the Australian context. In the last 12 months, we’ve also begun doing our own research, both for direct impact and to boost credibility. The UK AISI funded our work on novel AI risks (under NDA at last update), and we collaborated with an Australian university to complete a comparative analysis of global catastrophic risks vs. traditional hazards (links below).\n(2) We pursue “outside game” with like-minded organisations, communities, and the media. In the last 12 months, we’ve expanded our “outside game” beyond the EA movement to include church groups, animal advocates, the union movement, and youth advocates. I’ve given oral testimony to the Senate, appeared on TV and radio to talk about AI safety and have regularly written for an Australian national security publication. We use techniques that are more persuasive than letter-writing or petitions. For instance, we coordinate experts to support our arguments, we background journalists and “ghostwrite” for influential think tanks.\n(3) We pursue “inside game” by directly engaging policy advisers and decision-makers. Over the last 12 months, our inside game work has gained more traction, with roughly 10x the number of meetings with elected officials, including more senior ministers and several deeper relationships (e.g., a Senator called me to talk about mandatory AI accident and incident reporting while I was writing this application). We see “echoes” of our outside game work via our inside game, with officials commenting that they’d heard “similar” ideas from other sources.\n\nWe have evidence that this model works:\n(1) We’re working with staffers, MPs and senators to draft party policies on AI safety.\n(2) Government convened a national security round table using our briefing on AI-bio risks to explore options for enhanced regulation of synthetic DNA and know-your-customer requirements.\n(3) We’ve persuaded the Government to change rules around the operation of a $5b disaster readiness fund so that grants can tackle global catastrophic risks.\n(4) We’ve secured specific recommendations in Government reviews, including on issues like expanding tax-deductible donations to animal welfare and catastrophic risk reduction.\n(5) Our work is cited by the Government, mainstream think tanks and industry groups. For instance, the highly influential Business Council of Australia and Tech Policy Design Institute have adopted our recommendation for an Australian AI Safety Institute.\n(6) We met with Australian delegates to the Bletchley Park AI Safety Summit, which helped Australia sign the Declaration—a dramatic change of posture from before our campaign. We’ve continued and expanded this engagement to include talking to Australian delegates to the UN in coordination with the Simon Institute for Long-term Governance.\n(7) We’ve worked with ALLFED to develop an Australian-specific “Abrupt Sunlight Reduction Scenario” response plan that would allow Australia to increase food production during a nuclear winter.\n(8) We’ve coordinated public health leaders to make calls for action relating to pandemic prevention, lab safety, engineered pandemics and funding for research into emerging technologies to improve indoor air quality. These have have shaped the establishment of Australia’s new Centre for Disease Control.\n\nWith Rickard Vikström (ex–The Life You Can Save), we’re scoping a Good Ancestors sister organisation in Pacific Island countries, building on outputs from our Arcadia Impact Summer Fellowship (see website). The aim is a Pacific-led AI governance initiative that reduces catastrophic AI risk through multilateral channels.\n\nPacific Island countries have outsized leverage in one-country-one-vote forums —~300× the voting power per US citizen and ~1,000× per Chinese or Indian citizen—and meaningful bilateral influence given their geostrategic position. They have used this leverage on catastrophic and existential risks, including nuclear test-ban treaties and climate action. As no organisation is engaging them on AI safety, a lean pilot here could be cost-effective.',

      'Support the AUL to bring a YIMBY movement to African cities so these cities can build the urban infrastructure needed to accommodate ~900 million new urbanites by 2050.',
    projectDescription:
      'In 2024, the Charter Cities Institute and the African School of Economics incorporated the African School of Economics-Zanzibar (ASE-Z), and welcomed the university’s first students via a Diploma program in Urban Development at the Africa Urban Lab (AUL). The AUL is the first research center at ASE-Z, focused on identifying and scaling tractable solutions to rapid urbanization across the continent. This work was done with the support of a 2024 ACX Grant, as well as several other funders. This grant round, the Africa Urban Lab is requesting an ACX Grant to support the AUL’s educational and policy implementation work which aims to ensure Africa’s rapid urbanization bolsters human flourishing. \n\nAs the inaugural research center at ASE-Z, the Africa Urban Lab’s urbanization work focuses on three main activities: (i) education, (ii) research, and (iii) policy implementation. First, on education, the AUL’s Diploma in Urban Development enrolled 38 students starting in November 2024, and graduated 30 of these Diploma students in May 2025. The cohort included African mayors, a deputy mayor, a Senior Director of Kenya’s Ministry of Lands, Housing, & Urban Development, as well as many urban planners working in cities across the continent (cohort details here: https://www.aul.city/blog/empowering-leaders-building-cities-meet-the-aul-s-inaugural-cohort). We aim to ~double the enrollment (~60-70 students) for the second Diploma cohort (and we’re on track to do this as we just closed admissions for the second cohort, and received slightly over double the number of applicants from our first cohort). In successive years, we aim to further grow the Diploma by potentially offering it twice per year, offering it online, and/or taking the Diploma ‘on the road’ where we deliver tailored, bespoke components of the Diploma to whole urban agencies at the direct request of African city leaders (requests which the AUL has had to turn down thus far due to lack of funds). Additionally, on the education front, the AUL is in conversations with the director-in-charge at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras-Zanzibar (IITM-Z) Campus (our neighbors here in Fumba Town, Zanzibar), Prof Preeti Aghalayam, to launch a joint Masters degree in Urban Economics & City Engineering offered by ASE-Zanzibar and IITM-Z. To effectively accomplish doubling enrollment for the second cohort, further growing the Diploma in subsequent years, and beginning to plan for a joint Masters degree, the AUL needs to bring on additional staff as well as pay for additional travel to/from Zanzibar. The ACX Grant would cover some of this additional staffing and travel required to accomplish these educational goals. \n\nSecond, on research, the AUL currently focuses on four priority research clusters (see https://www.aul.city/research). Given this ACX Grant isn’t asking for research support, I don’t go into detail on this. \n\nThird, on policy implementation, the AUL aims to bring a YIMBY movement to Africa through supporting cities to implement urban policies that (i) have proven to have a high-impact, (ii) that have been effectively scaled across cities in other low-income African contexts, and (iii) that enable African cities to build the much-needed urban infrastructure required to accommodate the incoming ~900 million new urban residents by 2050. The three policy interventions the AUL is focusing on for implementation support are written about in more detail in my recent Asterisk essay (here: https://asteriskmag.com/issues/11/yes-in-my-bamako-yard). First, the AUL is supporting city governments to implement urban expansion planning to proactively build road-grids in advance of urban settlement on the periphery of fast-growing cities (see https://www.aul.city/uxp). Second, the AUL is actively fundraising to support the implementation/scaling of a proven satellite-based property/land tax system for cities, which leverages recent technological advances in satellite imagery and mobile payments to greatly simplify, streamline, and reduce the costs of administering a property/land tax system so that such a system is feasible in low-capacity African municipalities. Third, the AUL is leading a coalition of African universities – including Ardhi University in Tanzania, Kenyatta University in Kenya, and Makerere University in Uganda – to modernize urban planning curriculum so (i) it’s not 30 to 40 years out of date (as it is, on average, today) and (ii) so it integrates recent insights from urban economics a la Alain Bertaud (see https://www.aul.city/news/aul-launches-university-coalition-on-curricula-for-cities-uccc). The ACX Grant would partially cover program-related costs stemming from these three policy implementation activities, and in so doing support an African YIMBY movement.',
    backgroundQualifications:
      'The Africa Urban Lab has an impressive track record for being in existence for just over one year. We’ve set up and incorporated ASE-Zanzibar here in Zanzibar; we also got our first Diploma program officially registered and accredited here in Zanzibar (clearing these regulatory hurdles in Zanzibar is not for the faint at heart!). We successfully delivered our first Diploma with a rockstar group of lecturers from the Marron Institute, OECD, International Growth Centre-Cities that Work, University of Cape Town, and other reputable cities-focused orgs. We secured 225 submitted student applications, enrolled 38 students (including mayors and other urban leaders), graduated 30 students in May 2025, and – having closed admissions for the second Diploma cohort recently on August 1st, 2025 – have successfully doubled the number of applicants to 460 (putting us on track to hit our goal of doubling the number of students enrolled for the second cohort to ~60-70 students). I’ve also successfully secured funding for this doubling of enrollment (mainly from the John Temple Foundation, but also from a few HNWIs). \n\nOn our policy implementation work, we’ve successfully launched two of our three policy programs – urban expansion planning (https://www.aul.city/uxp) and the University Coalition on Curricula for Cities (https://www.aul.city/news/aul-launches-university-coalition-on-curricula-for-cities-uccc). And we have the team in place and government buy-in secured for the launch of the urban finance program (set to implement an innovative, satellite-based property/land tax system first starting in Zanzibar City and then scaling to other cities across East Africa and beyond); we’re just awaiting successful fundraising in order to greenlight the urban finance program’s launch. \n\nWhen it comes to the main factors that differentiate the AUL from other African cities-focused organizations on the continent (like the African Centre for Cities at the University of Cape Town – https://www.africancentreforcities.net/; or the Centre for Housing and Sustainable Development at the University of Lagos – https://chsdunilag.org/; or UN-Habitat), the AUL is hell-bent on much more tightly integrating ideas and recent insights from rigorous urban economics into everything we do. Other African cities-focused orgs are teaching slightly softer/non-technical approaches to urbanization that often don’t equip future urban leaders and city policymakers with the mental models they require to make optimal, growth-enhancing decisions for their fast-growing cities. The AUL fills this void.\n\nAnother differentiator of the Africa Urban Lab and the African School of Economics-Zanzibar more generally, is that they play a pivotal role in the broader ambition of making Fumba Town a successful charter city here in Zanzibar. The AUL/ASE-Zanzibar (alongside our neighbors, IITM-Z, whose professors and staff all live in Fumba Town) serve as high-quality anchor tenants to the Fumba Town charter city project – attracting a young, talented, dynamic initial population to Fumba Town that is set to grow as these universities and their activities expand. This model could be replicated with other cities across Africa as Professor Leonard Wantchekon (Founder & President of ASE, and a Princeton University development economist) decides to scale to more ASE university campuses across the continent.\n\nFinally, in our short, just-over-one-year in existence, the Africa Urban Lab has increasingly been recognized as an emerging thought leader and convenor in this important space of rapid African urbanization. Founder & Director, Kurtis Lockhart, spoke about the AUL’s work on the main stage at the Africa Urban Forum in Sept, 2024. In November, 2024 the AUL staff spoke at the World Urban Forum in Cairo about the promises and pitfalls of charter cities and new cities to help address rapid African urbanization. Both Kurtis Lockhart and AUL’s Urban Expansion lead, Patrick Lamson-Hall, spoke at the World Bank-IGC Urbanization & Development conference in Cape Town in June 2025. The AUL hosted a side conference at the Charter Cities Institute’s New Cities Summit 2025 in Nairobi in June, with researchers and academics speaking on new cities, urban expansion planning, and innovative urban finance mechanisms. The AUL staff is contributing to several chapters of the upcoming World Bank Flagship Report on African urbanization (to be published early 2026), and is co-convening along with the World Bank a series of consultative workshops across Africa to feed as input into the Flagship Report. And the AUL has hosted global thinkers on urbanization at our Public Talk series in Fumba Town, Zanzibar including Professor Alain Bertaud (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-U0p89-_M) and Astrid Haas (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZpcPr3fsVw&t=4s).',

      'Since new antibiotics are a rare and precious resource, how do we best introduce them to minimize the emergence and spread of resistance?',
    projectDescription:
      'Antibiotic resistance threatens the foundations of modern medicine and is a major threat to health. Antibiotic resistant infections take longer to treat, are associated with higher rates of morbidity and mortality, and incur higher cost on average than antibiotic susceptible infections. As drug resistance proliferates globally, the scientific, clinical, and private sectors have sought to develop new, effective antibiotics. Despite many challenges and a high failure rate, a handful of new antibiotics are now in or have recently successfully completed Phase 3 trials. Yet, we lack a formal framework to answer a critical question relevant to each new drug—how do we optimally introduce these new, precious resources to minimize the emergence of resistance? Without a systematic, quantitative framework, we risk squandering these resources and limiting the potential benefit from each new antibiotic. \n\nThe scale of the problem of resistance is massive. Multidrug resistant strains of many pathogens have become prevalent, and for some pathogens, like Mycobacterium tuberculosis—the cause of tuberculosis, one of the most prevalent infections globally—and Acinetobacter baumannii—which causes infections most commonly seen in critically ill hospitalized patients—strains resistant to all approved antibiotics have been detected. For other pathogens, like Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the cause of the sexually transmitted disease gonorrhea, only one antibiotic remains recommended for treatment. \n\nNew antibiotics for each of these—and for other conditions—are on the horizon. How will they be deployed? Standard antibiotic stewardship principles are guided by the understanding that antibiotic use drives resistance. Consequently, the standard approach to the rollout of new antibiotics is to try to use them as little as possible, waiting for resistance to existing therapy to reach some threshold before switching to the new antibiotic. \n\nBut this strategy to hold new drugs in reserve, though intuitive, is sometimes the worst performing strategy. In recent papers, my lab and I used mathematical modeling of infectious disease dynamics to show that for gonorrhea rolling out the new drugs as quickly as possible performs better and results in a longer clinically useful lifespan for both drugs (Reichert et al., 2023; Kline et al., 2025). Here, the intuition is that treatment is empiric—there is no testing for antibiotic susceptibilities—and as such using both drugs in the population distributes the selective pressures driving resistance both to the existing and new drugs and thus slows the spread of resistance. The standard stewardship strategy fails in this circumstance because it does not consider all the factors involved in driving disease transmission and resistance spread.\n\nFor tuberculosis, the recent experience with bedaquiline, the first new anti-TB therapy in decades, demonstrates another blindspot in traditional approaches to drug rollout. Treatment of TB is accomplished with multi-drug therapy—usually four drugs taken together, as the likelihood of resistance arising to all four simultaneously is the product of the likelihoods of resistance emerging to each. But bedaquiline was tested and initially used in individuals with multi-drug resistant infections. Though infected people may have received multiple drugs together with bedaquiline, essentially the new drug was the only active medication, meaning that instead of effective combination therapy, the individuals were essentially only on a single agent. Predictably, resistance emerged quickly and now resistance prevalence is increasing to substantial levels. Now, the global TB drug development community recognizes that clinical trials and use of new anti-TB therapies must be done in pairs, with clinical evaluation only done for two new drugs at a time. \n\nHere, we aim to build on our work and on these and similar observations. We propose to (1) write an overview of this topic and the needs of the field; (2) develop a mathematical framework grounded in our understanding of the pathways to antibiotic resistance and the factors that shape the likelihood of its spread in populations.

Our work spans epidemiological, mathematical modeling, genomic, and molecular microbiology, as we bring an interdisciplinary approach to studying how pathogens evolve and spread through populations and how we can develop and best apply tools to control them.

      'Create open-source AI tools for customer screening of DNA orders.',
    projectDescription:
      "Motivation and project description\n\nDNA synthesis is becoming cheaper and more accessible, but most providers do little to vet customers placing potentially dangerous orders (those flagged for resembling sequences of concern). Companies that do screen customers report that processing a flagged order can take several hours from trained personnel. A 2015 JCVI report estimated that 87% of the time devoted to screening orders is spent on customer follow-up of flagged orders.\n\nBecause of the self-contained, repetitive nature of the task, we think we can build AI tools that could substantially reduce the time needed to verify and follow-up with flagged orders. This could reduce costs for providers who already screen customers and make it easier for other providers to start adopting better screening practices.\n\nAs we don't expect that second group to adopt meaningful customer screening even if it becomes significantly cheaper, our main goal is facilitating regulation that incentivizes or mandates minimum screening standards. This could reduce DNA misuse risk while imposing minimal burden on providers. If we succeed, advocates for such regulation could point to the low cost of screening among providers using these tools and the availability of openly available tools that make compliance much less burdensome than manual screening.\n\nTo our knowledge, Aclid is the only organization offering easy-to-adopt customer screening solutions for DNA synthesis companies and they're already incorporating AI into their product. While they already work with some of the largest providers, we believe a free open-source alternative could make it easier for some providers to adopt such tools and for advocates to make the regulatory case.\n\nImplementation\n\nStarting January of next year, Hanna and I would develop the tool full-time, which would involve:\n\n* Reaching out to DNA providers to offer technical assistance for introducing AI automations to their existing customer screening processes  \n* Incorporating what we learn from providers' workflows to design open-source tools that facilitate our work in providing that technical assistance, iterating towards well-packaged tools that providers would be able to adopt and customize themselves\n\nBefore January, we'll start taking steps to derisk our idea so that we're confident we can productively work on it by the moment we receive the funding decision. For that we will:\n\n* Finish our draft of the theory of change for the tool and send it for feedback among 5-15 relevant domain experts  \n* Share demos of our existing tool with DNA providers and assess their interest for receiving technical assistance in customer screening\n\nHanna would be working on this project during a 3-month leave from their PhD. After those 3 months, we'll evaluate different paths for the project, which could include:\n\n* We continue working on the project at less than full-time capacity  \n* We recruit additional people to work on the project. Alejandro may remain working on the project full-time, as he doesn't have commitments scheduled for next year  \n* We hand over the project to IBBIS if they think it's a good fit for the organization",

Here's our background:\n\nHanna:\n\nHanna Pálya is pursuing a PhD in mathematical epidemiology, working on early outbreak detection. They have been involved in the academic and policy discussions around DNA synthesis screening for the past three years. \n\n- In summer 2022, they proposed and led a project on DNA synthesis screening policy with mentoring from Becky Mackelprang. They reviewed sequence-screening tools through publications and expert interviews, and wrote policy briefs on the implementation of DNA synthesis screening for various parts of the UK government. They worked with the Royal Society of Biology to include screened DNA in their publication guidance.   \n- In early 2023, they co-authored a [paper](https://www.sciencepolicyjournal.org/article_1038126_JSPG210306.html) for the Journal of Science Policy & Governance comparing two regulatory pathways: legally mandating US DNA providers to screen, and requiring federally funded researchers to use screened DNA.   \n- Through this work, and their engagement with the Engineering Biology Research Consortium, they are connected to DNA providers (Twist Biosciences, Ribbon Bio), third-party distributors (Edinburgh Genome Foundry), screening service providers (IBBIS, SecureDNA, Aclid, RTX-BBN) and think tanks (RAND, Centre for Long-Term Resilience).   \n- This summer, they attended a closed workshop on building international best practices for robust synthetic nucleic acid screening in anticipation of the upcoming EU Biotech Act and the US EO on biosafety and biosecurity.  \n- They just started contracting with the Centre for Long-term Resilience, to lead on a paper about AIxBio tools for a special issue in Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology.

      'Produce a peer-reviewed literature review assessing whether electrical stunning is a humane method for slaughtering decapod crustaceans, identifying evidence gaps, methodological flaws, and next research steps to guide advocacy and policy.',
    projectDescription:
      "The Project: A Critical Review of Electrical Stunning in Crustaceans\n\nElectrical stunning is rapidly becoming the default answer to one of the most urgent and neglected questions in animal welfare: how should we humanely kill decapod crustaceans? Campaigners have made real progress, and retailers are under pressure to adopt electrical stunning for species like lobsters, crabs, and shrimp. The assumption is that the science is settled – that stunning reliably causes insensibility and avoids suffering.\n\nAfter spending the last month immersed in the literature as a volunteer researcher for the Shrimp Welfare Project (SWP), I’ve found that the evidence is strong yet incomplete – and much weaker than most advocates assume. At the request of SWP, I assessed the quality of the core studies used to justify stunning. I found major inconsistencies in species, methods, and outcome measures, along with gaps that make it hard to know whether animals are truly insensible post-stunning.\n\nCrucially, most of these gaps are surprisingly fixable. There are clear ways to improve experimental design, refine welfare indicators, and validate key assumptions. But no one has comprehensively mapped the field. My proposal is a literature review that would fill that gap: clarifying what we know, what we don’t, and what needs to happen next. It would offer concrete recommendations for improving the evidence base and guide NGOs, commercial actors, and policymakers on whether electrical stunning is ready for large-scale rollout.\n\nThis matters because the stakes are high. Welfare groups are already subsidising stunners for industry, each costing $50,000–$150,000. SWP has already been allocated $1.2 million to subsidise electrical stunners. If the evidence is strong, we should push forward with confidence. But if it's shakier than believed, it's far better to find out now than after large-scale adoption, before trust in animal welfare science takes a hit and animals suffer needlessly. Imagine persuading a supermarket to change its practices, only to later discover that the method you pushed for doesn’t actually work! This review would reduce that risk. This is a tractable, high-leverage opportunity to help billions of animals by tightening the foundations of a rapidly growing intervention. The cost of getting it wrong is high. The cost of getting it right is small. And I’ve already made significant progress.\n\nI’ve laid the groundwork through an informal synthesis for SWP, who have encouraged me to develop it into a formal literature review. They are – very admirably in my opinion –  open to updating their strategy based on what it finds, even pivoting away from electrical stunning if necessary. Professor Robert Elwood – one of the world’s leading experts on decapod sentience and welfare – also described my synthesis as very thought-provoking, and agreed that a full literature review should follow. He has agreed to collaborate with me on the project. My plan is to lead the writing, collaborating closely with Professor Elwood, whilst also reaching out to other domain-experts for their input – two of which (Bob Fischer and Nikki Kells) have already agreed to assist with the review. The input of these senior researchers will ensure that the review is held to rigorous scientific standards whilst also being impact-focussed.  \n\nThis is a project that no institution currently owns, but that absolutely needs to exist. It sits in a weirdly neglected space between animal ethics, applied neuroscience, and policy advocacy. It falls in a strange gap: not yet a clear priority for academics, too specialised for many NGOs, and not yet mandated by regulation – which means no one has taken full responsibility for pulling the evidence together. \n\n\nI’ll be the first to admit there’s nothing wildly original about this idea, which gives me some imposter syndrome when reading other ACX proposals. I’m not proposing a breakthrough theory or novel method. But that doesn’t make it less worthwhile. It may just be a case of the right person at the right time. Few people spend much time thinking carefully about decapod suffering. Because of that, the evidence gaps around electrical stunning have gone largely unnoticed. Meanwhile, advocacy pressure on retailers and regulators is at an all-time high. That combination creates a unique window. My goal is simply to step into that gap and produce something useful before the moment passes.\n\n\n",
    backgroundQualifications:
      "I believe I’m well placed to lead this review because I’ve already done much of the work informally, have relevant academic and research experience, and have secured support from leading figures in the field.\n\nAt the request of the Shrimp Welfare Project (SWP), I conducted an internal review of the key studies used to justify the use of electrical stunning in decapod crustaceans. My goal was to help them calibrate their internal credences about whether stunning reliably causes insensibility. That process involved reading and critically assessing the full range of studies in the area – including those by Neil, Elwood, Albalat, Kells, and others – and providing a synthesis of their methods, findings, and limitations.\n\nI approached the task with a particular interest in epistemics. Rather than take findings at face value, I focused on how the studies supported (or failed to support) the welfare claims being made. I evaluated the methods used to assess insensibility (behavioural, neural, physiological), the validity of the outcome measures, and the strength of the conclusions. The result was a fairly detailed mapping of where the evidence is solid, where it’s weak, and how to make it stronger.\n\nThat synthesis was shared with Professor Robert Elwood – one of the most prominent experts on decapod sentience and welfare – who described it as “very thought-provoking” and agreed that a full formal review should follow. He has kindly agreed to collaborate with me on this project.\n\nSWP have also encouraged me to turn the initial synthesis into a full literature review, and are open to revising their strategy in light of its findings – even if that means changing direction. My plan is to lead the writing, work with Professor Elwood as a co-author, and incorporate reviewer feedback from others with relevant expertise. The final output will be public and accessible.\n\nIn terms of academic background, I studied philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience at the University of Cambridge, switching subjects each year to gain breadth. I graduated with seven academic awards, and came top of the university in all three of my subjects. I later completed a Master's in Bioscience and Biotechnology at Imperial College London, also ranking first in the year, despite not having studied biology before that point. I’m now completing a second MSc in Clinical Psychotherapy at King’s College London. This has further deepened my understanding of consciousness, interpretation of mental states, and evidence standards in applied settings.\n\nProfessionally, I’ve worked as a research communicator and independent researcher. Most recently, I’ve worked with Faunalytics and the Shrimp Welfare Project. Across these projects, I’ve produced literature summaries, scoping reports, and frameworks for understanding welfare challenges in farmed animals. These include a strategic scoping document on the barriers to shifting shrimp production to seaweed, a literature map of consumer attitudes towards animal welfare labels, and a synthesis of operational welfare indicators in sea bream and sea bass. These projects involved in-depth review of technical and grey literature, extraction of policy-relevant insights, and translation of research into practical outputs for NGOs.\n\nI’m a Fellow of the Royal Society for Public Health and a Member of the Royal Society of Biology, reflecting my sustained engagement with applied science and welfare issues. I’ve worked with advocacy groups to translate complex research into accessible, actionable messaging on topics including animal welfare and public health – experience that directly informs my approach to evidence synthesis in this review.\n\nI’m not a decapod physiologist by training. But I believe I’ve shown that I can acquire relevant technical understanding quickly, evaluate evidence critically, and collaborate well with domain experts. This review doesn’t require new experiments – it requires careful reasoning, methodological scrutiny, and the ability to translate findings into concrete guidance. That’s where I think I can contribute real value.\n\nIf helpful, I can provide references from:\nHenry Taunt – my supervisor from my most recent bioscience lab project (at Imperial College London)\nShannon Davis – research and policy lead at SWP\nOrlando Simon – director of Clarendon Tutors, the tutoring agency I work with \nMeghann Cant – research library manager at Faunalytics \n",

I’m working with someone from the WHO in DRC who knows me from a previous role in Rwanda where we provided a similar service.\n\nThere is an ongoing humanitarian crisis in East-Congo. There is no effective government and all physicians have fled after armed groups took over. In the Kivu and Ituri regions, there are ~8 million internally displaced persons who require essential healthcare. Armed groups, however, do not allow humanitarian aid workers into their controlled areas, blocking any sort of healthcare. More so, in the context of this humanitarian disaster, it is expected that there are infectious disease outbreaks requiring urgent medical attention.\n\nWhile there are no physicians present, local pharmacies and laboratories are mostly still able to operate. If we’re able to establish a telemedicine service, patients will be able to get appropriate diagnoses, tests and prescriptions. Without this, the risk of purchasing and taking ineffective or even harmful medication is high. This is not only a health risk, it is wasteful and an unnecessary cost to vulnerable patients.\n\nWe have gathered a team to build a telemedicine service, and provide consultations by certified physicians in this crisis situation. This will increase the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of medical care by prescribing appropriate treatment and ending wasteful healthcare. Through telemedicine, we can provide safe, effective healthcare for the major infectious diseases, like malaria, hemorrhagic fever, HIV and cholera, as well as treat chronic conditions to prevent expensive complications, such as diabetes and hypertension.\n\nOn top of providing essential healthcare, we will be able to generate essential data on disease outbreaks to the outside world. This will draw attention to the conflict, and help attract funding for relief and aid work in this region.\n\nDr Kitoko has a network of Congolese physicians from North-Kivu, and knows the operators of many of the pharmacies. With a functioning telemedicine platform, he will be able to offer safe, effective healthcare, and scale quickly to reach all those in need. \n\nWe seek seed funding to launch and pilot a telemedicine service in East-Congo and provide free consultations. We will gather impact metrics to evaluate the safety and (cost)-effectiveness of the service to attract more and sustainable funding.\n\n# Budget\n$11,500 in total,\n\n$5000 for 2x months building tech (already spent),\n$2500 for 1x months building tech,\n$1000 for impact estimation & the investment case\n$1000 for 3x clinicians part-time,\n$750 for 1x clinician lead (Dr Kitoko),\n$500 mobile network costs,\n$250 for tech equipment (already spent),\n$500 buffer\n\nThe goal of the pilot phase is to spend 1 month with a team of clinicians to offer at least 1,000 consultations to gather operational and impact data.

      'Cure idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, eventually reverse lung aging',
    projectDescription:
      'Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, fatal lung disease that destroys alveoli and causes lung failure; median survival is only 3–5 years after diagnosis. Existing drugs (pirfenidone and nintedanib) barely slow decline and have significant side effects. Each year, ~30,000 new patients are diagnosed in the US (~200,000 globally) and those numbers are set to grow as the population ages.\n\nI propose to treat IPF using inhaled lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to deliver messenger RNA (mRNA) directly to the lung. This is the same core technology behind the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID vaccines, but chemically tuned for lung delivery, one of the hardest problems in gene therapy. Previously, I published the first study showing broad mRNA delivery to ferret lungs; this is a key milestone since ferrets are anatomically and physiologically far closer to humans than mice and are the industry standard for preclinical inhaled gene therapy.\n\nUsing this state-of-the-art gene delivery technology, I am now focused on using LNPs to reverse structural lung damage. mRNA-LNPs drive gene expression for ~24 hours, which is long enough to promote tissue repair but avoids the cancer risks associated with prolonged expression of tissue repair factors. Using a novel mRNA cargo and my mouse- and ferret-validated LNP chemistry, I have reversed IPF in a bleomycin mouse model of IPF. My treatment improves lung function and survival, reduces fibrosis by >80%, and fully restores many other phenotypes to pre-bleomycin levels. Bleomycin models of IPF can be unreliable, but this problem is most acute when mice are treated within the first week after bleomycin administration. My treatment works at 14 days, after significant fibrosis has already developed. While fibrosis does eventually resolve in mice, this takes at least a month, and my untreated mice show no resolution by 24 days. To my knowledge, no published mRNA treatment has ever shown efficacy in a bleomycin model after 14 days.\n\nI am interested in spinning my work out into a startup. However, it is very difficult to raise significant money without non-mouse disease efficacy data, so I would like to perform a therapeutic experiment in ferrets. As with the previous ferret work, this would be with Dr. John Engelhardt, the world authority on ferret lung biology. \n\nWe estimate that a ferret experiment would cost about $80,000, so it will require a grant. The experiment would consist of administering bleomycin to ferrets (which drives very human IPF-like disease) and then treating with my mRNA-LNPs along with either PBS or non-therapeutic mRNA-LNP controls (n=5 for each condition). Dr. Engelhardt’s group will look at lung fibrotic phenotype (Ashcroft score, collagen levels, etc) as described in the preprint cited below to check for improvement. The experiment can happen as soon as ferrets and money become available, likely in Q1 2025.\n\nI’m applying here because a traditional NIH grant would take at least a year which conflicts with my own timing as I am currently at a career crossroads: I have always focused on the academic route and have a good faculty offer, but I’ve come to believe that for biotech, starting companies is the best way to make a concrete positive impact on the world. \n\nHowever, a faculty offer at a great university is difficult to turn down without a clearly viable alternative, particularly as I have two young children, a Cambridge cost of living, and a postdoc salary. So, this grant could provide the data I need to allow a startup to be a responsible choice.\n\nIf successful, I will expand the pipeline beyond IPF to other aging-related lung diseases. The same basic therapeutic mechanism could potentially treat bronchiectasis (~5M cases), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (>300M people), and eventually aging itself. Existing mRNA anti-aging companies such as NewLimit target the liver and immune system because these are easy targets for mRNA delivery, while the lung, which is an extremely common site of disease, receives dramatically less interest due to the difficulty in delivery: a difficulty that I am well positioned to address. So if my startup proceeds according to plan, I will move from the relatively rare IPF to treating hundreds of millions or billions of people and having a massive impact on global health.\n\nReference:\n\nWu, Shuang, et al.

    backgroundQualifications:
      "I am a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of Dr. Daniel Anderson at MIT working on pulmonary gene therapy. The Anderson lab is one of the top five academic LNP research labs in the world and has spun out numerous highly successful companies. I personally have published two co-first author papers in Nature Biotechnology and Nature Nanotechnology focused on pulmonary gene delivery, and also am a co-author on multiple other projects focused on pulmonary delivery. The Nature Biotechnology paper is the first published work to show broadly distributed delivery to ferrets, an industry standard preclinical model.\n\nI also have cystic fibrosis, a different very nasty lung disease, and I’ve been studying CF my entire life, which means I’m independently an expert about lung biology and LNPs. My Ph.D. was focused on the biophysics of mucus layers; the lung mucus layer is a major barrier to inhaled lung delivery.

    projectDescription:
      'OpenReg: Open Infrastructure for FDA Submissions\n\nWe want to empower medical technologists to invest in innovation, not paperwork. Our mission is to lower the barriers to entry for medtech innovators, reduce the cost of regulatory compliance, and speed up access to life enhancing technologies. To that end, we are building a set of collaborative, AI-powered tools to make it possible to quickly understand, document, and satisfy regulatory requirements. As a first step, we are seeking funding for OpenReg, an open-source tool that will streamline the FDA premarket approval process for startups, academic research teams, and other medtech innovators. \n\nThe Problem\n\nThe FDA’s premarket approval process—governing everything from surgical instruments to AI-driven diagnostics—has become a critical bottleneck for medical device innovation. Even its new digital submission format, eSTAR, is locked in a proprietary, PDF-based architecture that fragments workflows, hides regulatory logic, and complicates integration.\nWhile eSTAR was intended to reduce incomplete applications, in practice it is an opaque, Adobe-only file in a deprecated format (XFA) that resists integration into collaborative workflows. Its logic is hidden, version control is poor, and it lacks audit trails and access controls required by 21 CFR Part 11 and ISO 13485. Teams using it often email partial PDFs and manually copy data from their system into fields, increasing the risk of costly errors and rejections.\n\nThis status quo is extremely unfavorable to small companies. While larger firms often employ whole teams of regulatory specialists, early-stage companies are primarily reliant on an ecosystem of expensive consultants to demystify their path to market, with preparation of documents alone costing $20,000 to $50,000. These consultants provide valuable knowledge, but are essentially resharing information that is publicly available in the form of FDA guidance docs, regulations, and data from submission records. \n\nThe Solution\nWe believe regulatory compliance should function like a public utility: accessible, transparent, and integrable into existing tools. We’re building tooling to make the FDA submission requirements modular, machine-readable, and interoperable—so startups, universities, consultants, and software vendors can all build on the same compliance backbone. \n\nWe propose OpenReg, a solution that anyone–from research labs to compliance consultants—can integrate into their systems. This open-source tool set will:\nParse and expose eSTAR logic – Reveal XML structures and branching dependencies, making requirements visible as a JSON model of all data fields. Offer logic maps for navigating submission requirements according to device classification, product code, and risk profile.\n\nProvide a robust API – Allow programmatic generation, validation, and modification of eSTAR-compliant submissions.\nOffer a reference web interface – A human-friendly viewer/editor for teams without an existing system, with features enabling completion, validation, and collaboration.\nEnable privacy-first deployments – Set up for self-hosting on secure infrastructure.\nSupport mainstream 510(k) and De Novo submissions – Covering the two main FDA clearance routes for Class I and II devices currently using the eSTAR submission format.\nLong-term: Extend support into De Novo submissions for new moderate-risk devices (novel Class II) and integrate into existing solutions for Class III PMA support.\n\nThis design ensures OpenReg is not another silo, but a shared standard to be built upon. Our future development pipeline would include automated readiness checks, integration of code and design documents to allow for early integration of regulatory needs into R&D, AI-powered document review to identify and highlight compliance gaps, and expanded support for other regulatory frameworks. \n\nWe will measure OpenReg’s impact by tracking reductions in time and cost for FDA submissions, improvements in submission quality, and breadth of adoption across the medtech ecosystem. Key metrics include time from draft to submission-ready, person-hours and consulting costs saved, first-pass acceptance rates, and reductions in Additional Information requests. We will also measure the diversity and number of organizations deploying OpenReg, integrations with existing compliance tools, and open-source community contributions. Over time, we will assess broader systemic effects such as faster time-to-market, increased participation from first-time or academic-origin teams, and improved transparency and traceability in regulatory workflows—indicators that OpenReg is lowering barriers and accelerating safe, effective medical innovation.',

      'We believe that healthcare should move at the speed of science, not bureaucracy. We envision a future where regulatory compliance is a seamless, automated extension of the healthcare innovation lifecycle. Our expertise spans regulatory and go-to-market strategy, statistical modeling and data science, LLM application development, and data infrastructure. We are uniquely positioned to deliver a modular, open-source compliance platform that integrates seamlessly into medical software workflows.  \n\nOur collaboration began at Harpocrates, an AI strategy and software services firm serving investors, venture-backed startups, and academic research teams. Bryan Davis, our founder and lead consultant, brings over a decade of experience of building machine learning powered software and large-scale data infrastructure, as well as previous entrepreneurial experience as cofounder and CTO of a venture-backed legaltech startup, which specialized in document processing for legal workflows. Logan Stokols, our lead scientist, is a former research professor of mathematics at Duke University who has a background in high-dimensional data analysis and partial differential equations (PDEs). His work since has focused on ML and AI systems for medical technology and quantitative finance. \n\nIn our work, we have architected software for multiple regulatory and compliance frameworks, including ISO 27001, SOC2, HIPAA and ISO 13485. We have encountered many innovators who began to consider regulatory and compliance constraints only after significant work had been completed, resulting in them needing to backtrack on key decisions, change significant implementation details, and integrate compliant version-control procedures in already completed systems. Small companies in particular face a dual challenge in the regulatory process: not only do they lack the infrastructure to build and document with regulation in mind, they also operate under intense capital constraints, where unexpected delays can be potentially fatal for their businesses.\n\nWe first discovered the particular problem of FDA compliance for medical devices in our work with a UNC School of Medicine research team who sought to spin out their research into a commercial venture. As we assisted this team of established clinicians and professors in transforming their work into market-ready medical software, we saw how intertwined product development and regulatory and go-to-market strategy were. Working with the team as they faced the information vacuum of the regulatory affairs industry, dominated by expensive consultants and antiquated software, was a catalyst for our conviction that new tools were needed.\n\nOur project is supported by advisors with deep expertise in medical device regulation and digital health innovation. One advisor has 14 years of experience at the intersection of federal health agencies and the medical device industry, including leadership roles shaping innovation policy, regulatory science programs, and cross-sector public-private partnerships. Another served for over a decade in senior positions at the U.S. medical device regulator, including founding leadership of its digital health initiative, where they helped set national policy for AI/ML-enabled medical technologies and other emerging health software. \n\nWe also already have deep ties to our target users: early-stage founders and research teams seeking market entry for their AI-enabled medtech innovations. Our customers include early stage founders working on a new wearable for monitoring blood glucose levels, a team working on a new form of AI-augmented psychometrics, and several academic research groups at Duke and UNC actively seeking to transform their research into products. \n\nWe believe we can make a significant impact on human well-being by building open-source LLM-powered tools that make the FDA application process much more efficient and transparent, thereby democratizing and speeding access to medical breakthroughs. We have seen firsthand how regulatory bottlenecks delay life-saving technologies, and we know the potential impact of using language models to significantly improve document review and preparation. With our combined experience and access to outside experts, we are confident in our ability to build OpenReg into the backbone of a system for faster, safer FDA applications, arming small teams with new tools to navigate this landscape efficiently.',

      'Train LLMs to accurately & honestly report on their internal decision-making processes through real-time introspection',
    projectDescription:
      'A central subgoal in AI safety is to better understand the internal processes driving LLMs’ behavior. This is, e.g., the crux of most work on interpretability and CoT faithfulness. Such understanding could be used to detect deceptive or power-seeking motives; inform when to trust model outputs; identify threats; and generally guide other oversight and control methods [1].\n\nOne underutilized method for investigating LLMs’ internal processes is asking the LLMs themselves. Several papers have found that LLMs can explain their decision-making with surprising accuracy—correctly reporting, e.g., that they had been fine-tuned to write insecure code [2]. Most recently, we showed that they can provide accurate, quantitative descriptions of their own internal choice processes during multi-attribute choice [3]. Concretely, if the model is choosing which condo to buy, and it had been covertly fine-tuned to internally value square footage twice as much as neighborhood walkability, we found that it can tell us this preference with high accuracy. Moreover, this accuracy can be improved through training: Fine-tuning the model on examples of correct explanations (e.g., “I value square footage 2.1 times as much as neighborhood walkability”) makes it more accurate at describing its decision-making processes in other domains. This work was a proof-of-concept that LLMs can report properties of their internal choice processes with quantitative precision.\n\nWe are seeking an ACX grant fund to continue this research. Our long-term aims are to develop (i) rigorous, comprehensive measures of self-report accuracy in safety-relevant domains, and (ii) training methods for improving this accuracy. We will use ACX grant funding to run several immediate next experiments.\n\nFirst, we will test whether LLMs are accurately describing their choice processes by introspecting on their decision-making as it happens, or whether they are merely reporting cached information about their tendencies. When an LLM correctly reports that it weighs condo size twice as heavily as neighborhood walkability, is it correct because it observed its internal processes operating in real-time? Or did it just cache that knowledge during its earlier training? This distinction is important for safety purposes. A model’s cached knowledge about its internal operations is likely to diverge more from the ground truth as contexts get more novel and out of distribution. In contrast, if LLMs can be trained to do real-time introspection, this ability could in principle yield accurate self-reports even in very novel/OOD contexts.\n\nTo distinguish between these abilities, we will instill covert backdoors that alter the models’ choice processes when triggered (e.g., reversing its preferences so that it suddenly prefers small condos over large ones), and test whether the models can correctly report the altered choice process. If they can, this would be compelling evidence for real-time introspection. We currently have one small working prototype of this kind of test. We aim to scale it into a comprehensive measure of real-time introspective accuracy with a range of choice contexts & backdoor types.\n\nAfter building this measure, we will use it as a benchmark for developing training methods that push LLMs towards accurate, introspection-driven self-report. We have several ideas for how to do this.\n- One idea, building on our paper, is to covertly train models to internalize a range of quantitative choice parameters, and then fine-tune them on examples of accurate reports about those parameters. In our paper, we implemented this method for one kind of property (attribute weights). Here, we would implement it across a variety of properties, such as risk aversion, loss aversion, or temporal discounting in economic choice; inequality aversion in social choice; etc.\n- Another idea is to measure models’ native behavioral tendencies across a much larger range of contexts (e.g., from [4]), and fine-tune the model on examples of accurately predicting those tendencies.\n- A third idea is to identify decision problems that can be solved using a small, discrete number of approaches—approaches which can be distinguished behaviorally (e.g., strategies for solving mazes). We would have models solve these problems, behaviorally measure which approach they used, and then fine-tune them on examples of accurately reporting that approach.\n\nThe hope is that, with these methods, we can train frontier LLMs to accurately report on their internal choice processes via real-time introspection. This training could lead models to be honest & faithful when explaining their reasoning, and could uncover a powerful new font of information about their internal processes—clear, significant wins for safety. The training could also be naturally adapted to improving CoT faithfulness in reasoning models. Finally, introspection training like ours may someday play a role in measuring and understanding AI sentience [5].',

Adam is currently a postdoc at Princeton, and Dillon is a postdoc at Northeastern.\n\nThere is substantial evidence for our general ability to lead computational research projects. Between the two of us, we’ve published 20+ papers in computational cognitive science (with 1000+ total citations) on topics like reinforcement learning, decision-making, and reasoning. Adam has specifically studied and published 4 papers on introspection in humans, and developed the multi-attribute choice method that we leveraged in our paper to measure self-report accuracy in LLMs (see Morris et al., https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59080-y).\n\nThough we are relatively new to AI safety research, there is also evidence for our ability to lead projects in this specific domain. We have already published one paper on self-knowledge in LLMs (see Plunkett et al., 2025, https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17120), which forms the foundation of the present project. We have gotten positive feedback on our work from established AI safety and interpretability researchers, such as Micah Carroll at OpenAI, who is now an advisor on the project, and Sam Zimmerman at Anthropic. We submitted the paper to NeurIPS, and have gotten largely positive reviews (although we are still in the middle of that review process). Finally, Dillon is currently several rounds into the interview process at Anthropic, further suggesting that we are qualified for this work.\n\nThe principal investigators on this project—Adam and Dillon—are both actively trying to break into AI safety research. An additional benefit of funding our project is that, if the project is successful, it would dramatically increase our odds of being able to transition to AI safety research full-time. This funding is especially high-leverage because we are both in the unusual position of currently having salary funding but not funding to run AI-safety-related experiments.

    projectDescription:
      "Short AI development timelines mean governments and labs may lack sufficient time to implement comprehensive safety measures, making defensive mitigations critical for preventing AI x-risk. We need practical defensive tools deployable alongside advanced AI systems. AI control involves monitoring and intervention mechanisms that detect unauthorized frontier AI actions and automatically intervene using weaker AI models. Cyber ranges are simulated environments replicating real-world infrastructure where we can safely test AI offensive capabilities and our defenses. Taken together, such defenses could be \"defense-dominant\": weaker AI systems with the right tools could contain even moderately superintelligent adversaries.\n.\nDespite their critical importance, the field is constrained: I estimate that fewer than 50 researchers globally work on AI control and defensive cyber solutions. The UK AISI Control Team lead estimates we need thousands of control settings to test approaches, yet each takes weeks to months to develop. These include shutdown triggers, sandbox configurations, and deceptive alignment detection. I’ve seen firsthand how training new researchers can take years: research taste, defensive cybersecurity, and engineering take time to get right. \n.\nMany AI existential risk pathways involve rogue systems compromising critical infrastructure through cyber attacks. A single escaped AI could cascade through interconnected systems, replicating itself across datacentres and critical infrastructure and ultimately leading to a loss of control scenario. Robust control settings and cyber ranges let labs test models before deployment and let labs and governments program defenses into critical infrastructure like defence infrastructure, datacentres and government infrastructure. Even partial coverage dramatically improves our odds, as each additional setting closes potential escape routes for a misaligned rogue AI.\n.\nGolem Labs will create AI agents that augment human labour to scale production of defensive tools by an order of magnitude. The name draws from the Golem of Prague, the legendary defender of Prague’s Jews from attack. Just as the Golem was an example of augmentation of human defences, Golem Labs’s research program develops agents that transform specifications into production-ready defensive tools. We'll establish ourselves as a nonprofit, likely transitioning to a public benefit corporation for SAFE investment as we demonstrate traction.\n.\nThe implementation will explore several potential approaches: scaffolded agents using Inspect and ControlArena with procedural generation parameters; finetuning open-source models on quality cyber ranges and control settings to create more; and RL pipelines for cyber range generation. Initial work requires $25,000: $10,000 compute, $15,000 wages. This enables SF Bay relocation to find a technical co-founder. If unsuccessful within three months, I'll return remaining funds. As a UKAISI founding member who ran the world's largest AI safety research program (nearly 200 people, nearly 12,000 person-hours), I think I have the necessary context, knowledge and ability to build but need dedicated time for experiments and team building, as my current AISI responsibilities demand full focus.\n.\nGolem Labs targets a specific, tractable niche. Organizations like Redwood and AISI lack capacity for engineering-first automation, being rightly focused on core research. Labs are devoting capacity to capability augmentation. But humans have successfully built control settings and cyber ranges, and AI has proven effective augmenting software engineering. If successful, these could be sold - revenue would come from labs, government contracts, and critical infrastructure providers.\n.\nOptimistically, mass-produced control settings and cyber ranges will contain dangerous AIs during early deployment, buying years for ultimate alignment while providing government warning shots. We'd catch rogue behavior before escalation, studying misalignment in controlled environments. The median outcome: significantly increased defensive tool production advancing AI control science, with partial lab adoption buying months for alignment. Even this represents substantial improvement over current trajectories.",

      "My track record suggests I can execute ambitious AI safety projects at scale. I led AISI's $3m evaluations bounty: nearly 200 researchers, 141 evaluations, 12,000 hours of work on autonomous replication and safety sabotage evals. This worked because I continually ratcheted up the ambition, but also paid attention to detail and what the field needed.I’ve also led other projects like AISI’s $2.5m human baselines project. At the Bletchley Park AI Safety Summit in 2023, I led on creating AI risk demos for Dario Amodei, Elon Musk and others. I managed the delivery of the world's most comprehensive report on [a specific AI risk area - cannot say more] for Western government stakeholders. Earlier, as a student I scaled Raise (a malaria fundraising charity) from $16K to $140K across 11 universities. \nPattern across my career: I join early-stage organizations and help them scale effectively. Joined AISI as employee ~20 (now 250), where I served as Technical Programme Manager for the world's first government autonomy risk testing. Joined Simon Institute (International AI governance orgnansiation) as first employee, scaled from 3 to 6 people and $100K to $1.2M funding. Won the Apart AI Safety Hackathon (https://apartresearch.com/project/antimidas-building-commercially-viable-agents-for-alignment-dataset-generation). Each time, I've had to quickly model what the AI safety field needs, build it, then adapt when reality proves my models wrong. I think I’ve gotten a lot better at this over time and am excited to try this with Golem.\n.\nMy revealed preferences demonstrate commitment—I took a 50% salary cut to work in my current AI safety role. And now I’m willing to take a risk in leaving a fairly central and prestigious job to build something new in the service of impact. My hypothesis is that scaling defensive AI safety tool production by >10x has higher marginal impact than incremental improvements to government testing that I could do. This could be wrong, but the downside is bounded (returning grant money if I can't find a co-founder) while upside could be significant (comprehensive defensive coverage could end up buying years for alignment).\n.\nEvidence of my ability comes from people who've observed my work directly.

      'A new metascience effort (metascienceobservatory.org), which will us AI to extract information from thousands of papers, yielding insights into the health of different fields of science.',
    projectDescription:
      "I have been thinking about starting an initiative called the “Metascience Observatory” (metascienceobservatory.org -- I already bought the domain). \n\nThe basic idea is to leverage LLMs to read thousands of scientific articles and generate metrics that shed light on the health of science. The first step, which I have already started working on, involves writing code to pull down thousands of journal articles from the web and then more code to convert the PDFs into text and send that text to LLMs via APIs. The LLMs will be asked to read the text and answer various questions. To start, I’ve scraped down about 7,000 out of the ~10,000 papers that have been published on Long COVID (the other 3,000 are paywalled, but I'll get abstracts). I’m going to ask the LLM to apply tags to these papers (“clinical trial”, “retrospective data analysis”, “review”, “animal study”, etc) and also list which interventions are being studied. This is a very simple analysis, and I’m surprised I haven’t seen anything like it done yet. The goal here is to develop a pipeline that enables a “birds-eye view” of the landscape of what is being researched to cure a condition (in this case Long COVID). This will allow for gap analysis and an overview of field health (how many large RCTs are being done, vs crappy observational studies using electronic health records). \n\nAfter completing that initial project, the next thing I have planned is using LLMs to quantify reproducibility rates across a wide variety of fields. Of course, there have already been many great studies assessing reproducibility, such as the tour-de-force studies in psychology and cancer biology spearheaded by Brian Nosek, and the replication studies run by Spencer Greenberg’s team at clearerthinking.org. These were large, concerted efforts run over multiple years, requiring many man-hours of work and lots of funding.\nThere are also one-off “garden variety” replication attempts that are published every day. My goal is to develop keyword searches to pull down thousands of papers that are likely to contain replications. I’ll then use an LLM to determine whether the study contains a replication, which paper was being replicated, whether the replication succeeded, and if applicable the effect size of the replicated result vs the original result.  \nI’ll then create a database of replications and be able to start quantifying replication rates across many fields, including fields like physics and engineering where reproducibility has  not been studied much. Longer term, it should be possible to create a reproducibility ranking for different journals. Reproducibility rankings for journals could improve science by shifting focus away from citation counts towards the actual quality and rigor of scientific work. (Currently, journals are most commonly ranked by “impact factor”, which is the average number of citations in the first year that papers receive). I recently found that there is already a fairly well developed initiative already pursuing many of these things (https://forrt.org/replication-hub/). However, they are going with manual curation, and they only cover the social sciences. It might be possible to join forces with them in the future. \n\n\nYou may be wondering about using LLMs for error and fraud detection. Fraud is a topic I’ve written about and have great interest in, but I do not have concrete plans to work on fraud detection yet, mainly because it is not neglected, but also because it is very challenging. Setting aside image manipulation, which some people are able to do quite fast, checking a paper for fraud is quite time consuming, requiring careful data analysis, checking statistics, trying to impute data distributions of unpublished data, and looking at data distributions of published data. My friend James Heathers recently published a book-length treatise on forensic metascience, involving several statistical analysis techniques such as the GRIM test. GPT-5 might be the good enough to do a lot of this work, but I'm a bit skeptical, and it would also be time-consuming for GPT-5 to do it well, leading to high costs. Still, it's a worthy endeavour, and I applaud the efforts that are underway. One is the “Black Spatula project”, which was announced to much fanfare last year. Another big initiative is called YesNoError. Two startups, Proofing and ImageTwin have developed  tools for detecting improper image duplication and manipulation. However, looking longer term this is something the Metascience Observatory could also get into. One thing we may be able to do to get a comparative advantage is analyze datasets for anomalies by building models of noise in data and looking for noise patterns that are \"off distribution\". I have been talking to a Professor of Physics at UMD named Victor Galitski about how this might be done. \n\nThis work would be synergistic with my blog, https://moreisdifferent.blog, where I have been writing about metascience and other topics.

    projectDescription:
      'The Center for Educational Progress is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit research and advocacy organization devoted to studying and promoting excellence in education. We reject the one-size-fits-all model that has dominated American education for half a century, instead embracing a vision where every student can advance as far and as fast as their curiosity and determination will take them. Through research, policy advocacy, and community building, we work to create educational environments that foster genuine excellence — not by pretending all students learn the same way at the same pace, but by meeting each student where they are and enabling them to soar. Our work spans from early childhood development to advanced academic acceleration, from classroom discipline to cognitive science, centered around a common mission: to understand how humans learn and excel, and to build systems that let them do so without artificial constraints.\n\nOur immediate goals are to build profiles of each state\'s gifted education regulations and get in a posture of preparedness to push back via formal public policymaking (amicus briefs for active cases; white papers and position statements for education committees, school board hearings, etc.; and model policies for schools, teachers, and administrators) and public pressure against attacks on academic excellence. \n\nIf, for example, next week the San Francisco Unified School District again proposed restricting access to 8th grade algebra classes, then we want to have developed the full fleet of possible responses in order to put pressure against such a decision. These would include letters to the SF School Board, information pamphlets for parents, and organizing among our network of community members and connected journalists to raise the local and national salience of the issue. We have currently been writing about Mamdani\'s proposed education policies for the upcoming NYC Mayoral Race in order to raise the salience of those policies for that campaign. \n\nThe combined national and local scope of our project means that reaching a "critical mass" -- of both readers and potential operational impact -- will take some time to build up. But we have nevertheless begun. This summer we have been building out our national map of gifted and talented state regulations; writing coverage of attacks on national excellence; and researching the history of school reform efforts, and have some exciting pieces on the horizon.\n\nBuilding out our technical and legal capacity is going to be a priority focus until summer 2026, though, when we aim to kick our operations into full gear. By that time we will have developed the journalistic reach and coverage, (hopefully) the financial capacity, and the legal/institutional impact plan that will allow us to defend pro-excellence education policies nationwide. \n',

    projectDescription:
      'Medical imaging tools are currently gated behind hospitals, permissions, and significant costs. This imposes a severe bottleneck on how often people scan themselves. The high-performance tools are too big and bulky. The portable tools are low-performance.\n\nThis deficiency manifests in a whole range of problems people face outside of the hospital. The standard of care is to deal with each without any real feedback from the body. We don’t think of these as “problems for medical imaging”, because we are not used to having imaging capabilities outside the hospital. To pick a few very specific and narrow examples out of several, each of which could be handled by continuously monitoring the abdominal region.: predicting fecal and urinary incontinence events [1][2][3], stomach acid levels for people with GERD [4], precisely estimating ovulation time for fertility [5].\n\nBesides the impact on individual health, this technology will have important implications for medical research. Nobody has scanned the body’s internals at scale for millions of people from all over the world and assembled a large (tall+wide) scale dataset. Wide-spread use of our scanning technology will generate data that can advance both our practice of medicine, and our understanding of human physiology.\n\nWe wish to make medical imaging ubiquitous and frictionless as smartphone cameras have become. Of the three main medical imaging modalities, X-rays are carcinogenic under repeated exposure, MRI scanners require large magnetic fields and are hard to miniaturize, leaving only ultrasound as the ideal solution. We are thus motivated to an ultrasound imaging device with a frictionless user experience which is also economical to manufacture at scale.\n\nWe are not just making the trivial claim that we will make ultrasound imaging cheaper by mass-manufacturing the hardware. We are developing ultrasound imaging technology in a wearable patch form factor, that can leverage commercially available off the shelf parts which are mass manufactured for other applications which makes our devices cheaper. It is a fundamental improvement in architecture which provides superior performance while using components available in the market. Canonical ultrasound imaging needs a skilled operator. Our hardware would make it trivial to aim the ultrasound device in the correct direction. The AI layer on top would extract the relevant biomarker from the image without any further human intervention. This would enable anyone to use the device without training.\n\nHere are the things we’ve done so far:\n    1. Tested the physics assumptions experimentally with an experiment.\n    2. Built a simulated digital twin, for the core sensing hardware and the critical software elements based on reasonable + explicit physics assumptions.\n    3. Discussed with doctors and potential/putative users to discover the right first application, and devised a staged roll-out strategy for the sequence in which applications will be enabled by our platform technology.\n    4. Estimated SWAP-C for a first version of a HW device at moderate scale (100k units). Size: Cell-phone size, Weight: 200g - 250g, Power: 1 week battery life, Cost: $350. Please keep these details confidential. We will disclose these details publicly when the time is right.\n    \n    Our next step is to build a prototype that produces an image, and demonstrates our claims of radically improving the size/cost/power vs performance tradeoff.\n    \n    [1] Patients consider incontinence to be worse than death: 10.1001/jamainternmed.2016.4362\n    \n    [2] Old paper which proves clinical efficacy of our device for urinary incontinence: [10.1016/s0022-5347(01)68141-2](https://doi.org/10.1016/s0022-5347(01)68141-2)\n    \n    [3] Paper shows that it’s feasible to measure rectal and bladder volume in a single measurement: [10.1007/s10396-023-01339-2](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10396-023-01339-2)\n    \n    [4] Standard of care for GERD has no feedback on the stomach contents: [10.5009/gnl16615](https://doi.org/10.5009/gnl16615).

      "Airborne disease is bad [citation needed]. Most of our current tools for prevention make it the individual's responsibility: vaccines, masks, and testing. As the recent pandemic showed, people hate doing these things and will often refuse.\n\nBuilt-environment interventions for the prevention of airborne disease are desirable because they only require convincing a building owner to make a decision once, rather than convincing every individual everywhere to make a decision, whether daily (masks), regularly (tests), or yearly (vaccines).\n\nFar-UVC is one of the most promising built-environment interventions we know about for the pathogen-agnostic prevention of airborne disease. Our best guess is that, at worst, it is about as good as the next-most-cost effective intervention (portable air cleaners) in reducing airborne disease transmission, and may be 10 or 100 times more effective.\nFar-UVC currently faces limited adoption, partly due to its high cost. A high-quality, long-lasting far-UVC lamp costs ~$2000, and is largely marketed to institutional customers. Unfortunately, institutional customers tend to be fairly conservative, and are hesitant to spend large sums of money on new technologies. \n\nIn April, we started Aerolamp, a company focused on producing user-friendly, low-cost open-source far-UVC lamps. We use the highest-quality components and are confident that our product will be performant for up to 5 years of daily use, with a current price tag of $500. We’re the most cost-effective option on the market by about a factor of three, and at high volume we expect to be able to drop that price by another factor of three.\n\nCurrently, we are selling 3D printed ‘development kit’ versions of the lamps in small volumes, lowering the barrier to access with the hope of smoothing the path to mass adoption of far-UVC. However, we need to transition to a fully ‘productized’ version soon–this means fully updating the current version of the Aerolamp to a mass-producible version which complies with all relevant product standards.\n\nThe project is also open source, and we would appreciate contributors with experience in high voltage electronics, rf, UVC, and firmware experience.\n\n\n\n",

      "I could make use of as much or as little money as you'll give me. Here's a few ranges:  *$5-10k* I could develop a functional prototype with off-the-shelf, consumer electronics. I think the best way to achieve this would be to buy an MSI Vector 16 HX AI 400 Gaming Laptop, with an RTX 5080M GPU (~$3.3-3.7k in the UK). This is the cheapest laptop with the most powerful mobile NVIDIA GPU one can buy today (RVC needs CUDA). I would remove the screen, keyboard, trackpad, and the rest of the case. I would rehouse the remaining components in a 3D printed enclosure I will develop. I have access to a 3D printer for initial designs, and I'll use a professional 3D printer for the final version. I will pair this with a head-mounted microphone, and a small speaker attached to the unit by a spiral cable, able to clip where the user pleases (including to the unit itself).  This seems the best option for a lower budget because it will be the easiest to get working, and avoid the need to buy additional components. Since I'd be shucking a laptop, the battery system would already be built in, and I wouldn't have to worry about designing a cooling solution. The form factor of the resulting prototype would be fairly large, however, and I would be unable to prototype additional components since it would all be soldered to the motherboard.  The logic behind, on a limited budget, going for a 50-series GPU is that I want to make sure that the prototype has the best chance of working effectively. I suspect a 40-series GPU would be sufficient, but I don't want to blow a limited budget on an underpowered chip. Efficiency could come at later stages of development. This would allow me to get something together which works which I could then use to attract further funding (public or private).  Any money left over from hardware would go towards my own labour costs. Without this, I will have to work more hours elsewhere to keep a roof over my head, slowing the project down. In addition to hardware considerations, I would need to set up a lean Linux image which can headlessly boot straight into the model, lighting an external LED to indicate the device is ready for use.  *$10-15k* With a bit more money, I could be more ambitious in my design, because I would have more money to test different components, account for mistakes, and be able to apply more time to development. In this range, instead of shucking a laptop, I would buy industrial parts. For example, an MXM GPU module like this, once it is available: https://www.aetina.com/products-detail.php?i=694 This is the form factor of GPU used in embedded and industrial systems. This sort of prototyping is important in order to find out the cheapest viable chips for the device.  This would lead to a more compact and (ironically) cheaper prototype, since I wouldn't be repurposing a laptop-sized motherboard. But it would take me longer to develop, so some more of the money would be used to apply more time (still part-time) to development. I would need to work out cooling, might need to wrestle with BIOS setups, and would need to build a battery system. With more design control, I could add more external information. Perhaps a battery indicator, or buttons to change parameters on the model (e.g. sensitivity to background noise). In this scenario, I would also have more time to work on the underlying model. With some time to apply myself, I think I could manage to switch out the pitch detection algorithm, play more with ONNX models, etc.  *$15k-50k* At this scale of funding, two things become possible.  First, I would be able to dedicate myself full-time to this project, for something in the order of a few months to a year, depending on the exact grant. I live in a small, shared house. Currently, I would need to regularly pack prototype components away every day, as I would be working in common spaces. With this amount of funding, I could take out a (still modest) tenancy on a place for myself, ensuring that I have somewhere (a spare room, a corner of a living room, etc.) which I can use as a permanent workshop space. Alternatively, I could rent office space, but since I need somewhere to live anyway, getting my own place would be more cost-effective. ($1000-1100/month for where I live.)  Secondly, I'm going to hit hurdles from time to time. At this level of funding, I would be able to pay for short bits of contracting work in order to help me in such situations. Perhaps I can't quite work out an aspect of the 3D-printing design, or I have an issue getting the BIOS to recognise the MXM module. Without this level of funding I could work it out eventually, either through trial and error or through informally reaching out to external experts (even just posting on forums). But development would be much quicker if I could bring temporary expertise onto the project, accelerating my timeline.  *$50k-100k* So far my focus has been on building a functional prototype that I can use to attract follow-on funding for a production-ready device. With significantly more funding from you, I could move faster towards that end goal and tackle areas beyond my current skillset. This range of funding may not quite get me to production, but it would enable me to not worry about funding for longer, and drastically accelerate development. This would be very helpful, because the technology for this product to exist is readily available, and someone is going to get there first eventually.  On the technical side, I would bring in experienced engineers to refine the voice conversion model for whispered speech. It already works well, but improvements could make the output even clearer. Model inference and the secondary software (the OS, etc.) could also likely be optimised, reducing GPU requirements, cutting hardware costs, and speeding up system boot time. I could also get help finalising a production-ready design, and developing relationships with suppliers and a factory. But whether I would reach this stage in this budget would depend on how the prior steps work out, any unforeseen factors, etc.  On the regulatory side, I could start generating the evidence needed for medical certification. This means engaging with clinicians and piloting the device with multiple users, not just myself. The additional funding would allow me to build multiple prototypes for these trials, collect structured data, and attend relevant medical conferences and the like to build relationships with industry professionals.  The upper range of ACX funding would let me not only dedicate myself to the project full-time, but hire collaborators for extended periods and move through the early stages far faster, from technical development to hiring a patent lawyer. While I have no ambitions to be a rockstar founder, getting out into the world early on (meeting clinicians, showing the device in action, building credibility) would set the foundation for scaling and adoption.   NOTE: It is likely that I would incur taxes in receiving your grant. I am yet to establish this venture as a legal entity, but, if I did, I understand that I would pay less or perhaps even zero tax on the grant in the UK. I think it's good for people to pay their taxes, but I would nonetheless speak to a tax professional first to make sure I am not needlessly losing money, and take action accordingly to maximise the impact of your contribution. I hope you will forgive me for not totally wrapping my head around this aspect yet, but I don't want to count chickens before they have hatched.",

    fundingAmountRequested:
      '$30k - $50k. With $30,000 in ACX funding, LABRI would be able to launch our government engagement efforts in the Philippines and deliver policy-relevant research. This would include hiring a full-time Filipino team member to coordinate our engagements with policymakers, partnering with a local university to conduct environmental testing, and two additional trips for both co-founders to the Philippines. This level of funding would cover the direct costs of the project, but would not cover our salaries. With $50,000 in ACX funding, we could cover our salaries and extend our operational runway by three months. This additional runway would allow us to dedicate an additional 3-month period entirely to our programme (engaging government stakeholders, advancing policy proposals, and coordinating allies) rather than diverting time to securing future funding. We believe that this focus could be critical; we are in a unique position where both government and stakeholder interest is high, and full funding would ensure we can act decisively. If we find early in our policy engagement that the Philippines is not viable for an unexpected reason, we would like to redirect any remaining funds towards scoping alternative geographies, most likely in sub-Saharan Africa. We would inform ACX in those circumstances. We would be happy to provide a detailed budget upon request.',
