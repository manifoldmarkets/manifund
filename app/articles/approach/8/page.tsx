        What About Different Value Systems?
      </h2>
      <p>
        One limitation of this model is that it’s not obvious how well it applies
        to entities that don’t naturally fit into standard economic models because
        they can’t easily participate in markets: children, animals, people who
        might exist in the distant future. For people whose value systems heavily
        incorporate any of these groups’ preferences, <i>all</i> market-based funding
        solutions might prove inadequate. In these cases, funding is closer to a
        strict question of altruism than a coordination problem; donors have to
        speculate on behalf of those who can’t (financially) speculate for
        themselves. These causes lend themselves better to direct improvements
        in prediction and evaluation than to financial mechanisms that couple
        those steps with fronting and paying out; it’s not really clear how you’d
        align your own incentives with the incentives of someone in the year
        2300, except by saying “I care abstractly about making future people
        happy.”

        Even in these areas, though, there are often some smaller subproblems
        related to coordination, and so market mechanisms can offer at least
        some improvements. For example, grant proposals often become the
        victims of “funder chicken,” where each potential donor, having a
        limited budget, likes a proposal but hopes one of the others will fund
        it first. And even if you can’t evaluate one year from now whether a
        project intended to improve outcomes on a century-long timescale has
        succeeded in that, you can at least check whether the project did what 
        it said it would, or whether it achieved the kind of result that you
        already believe for other reasons would be valuable for the far future.
        it’s hard to incentivize terminal goals this way, but for incentivizing
        instrumental goals, market structures are pretty good.
      </p>
      <p>
        On some level, you can think of altruism <i>itself</i> as a public good:
        like, ten thousand people are all sad about cows getting factory-farmed
        and would rather the cows be freed to roam on beautiful verdant
        pastures, and so cow liberation is a public good to all those people
        insofar as it’s something that would make them all happy. This doesn’t
        necessarily evaluate how much the <i>cow</i> would prefer freedom to its
        current life; you could just as easily imagine that ten thousand other
        people would enjoy seeing a herd of cows dressed up in identical little
        bow ties, and so purchasing a pack of wide-necked bow ties would be a
        public-goods-funding coordination problem in just the same way. The
        “figuring out what would be best for cows” problem, and below it the
        more fundamental “figuring out what my altruistic values are” problem,
        aren’t easily solvable by markets. But in either case, once you make
        up your mind as to what your goals are, market mechanisms become useful
        tools to help you get there.
