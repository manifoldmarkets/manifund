        Manifund’s Approach to Thinking About Charitable Funding
      </h1>
      <p>
        From 2023 retrospective: “Our initial thesis was that grant applications and screening largely can be done in public, and should be.”

        Economic Experimentation
      </h2>
      <p> 
          Manifund’s sister company, Manifold, runs experiments with
          prediction markets. Because Manifold runs on play money, and because
          users get to participate on the market-creation side as well as the
          prediction side, it’s arguably the best playground in the world for
          experimenting rapidly with financial mechanisms. Since official
          currency isn’t involved, both Manifold and its users (and the two in
          combination) can run experiments rapid-fire without jumping through
          many hoops. For instance, Manifold has tried various types of
          automatic market-making algorithms, mechanisms for multiple-choice
          questions, short selling, limit orders, contests, leagues, even a
          dating app spinoff. And users have made bots, non-question questions
          like “___ stock (never resolves)”, markets that serve as bounties to
          incentivize particular events to happen, questions with meta
          resolution criteria like “Will the total volume of YES trading on
          this question be more than x mana?”.

        Manifund is different, because lots of real money is moving through our
        programs. But we’re still small and fast-moving,
        and our ethos is similar: we aim to be an incubator
        for lots of small- and medium-scale experiments testing out funding
        mechanisms for charity and public goods.

        Effective altruism originally asked the question, “What properties make
        a charitable project useful, efficient, and valuable?” Manifund is an
        attempt to extend that question in two ways:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          What kinds of systems incentivize projects that have those properties?
          </li>
        <li>
          How can we use improvements to the grantee experience to make funding
          programs more effective?
        </li>
      </ol>
