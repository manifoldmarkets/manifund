        Manifund’s Approach to Thinking About Charitable Funding
      </h1>
      <p>
        <br />
        There are a couple of things to notice here.
      </p>
      <h3>
        some distinctions don’t always occur
      </h3>
      <p>
        “predict” and “evaluate” are often the same, as are “front” and “pay
        out”. these are for cases where money is given out ahead of time, in a
        way that’s – well, not no-strings-attached, the founders have to make a
        reasonable attempt and not just grab the money and run off to hide out in
        antarctica; but it’s not contingent on the project actually succeeding.
        maybe the company goes bust, the idea doesn’t work, the nonprofit falls
        apart, whatever. or maybe the project does what it says it will, but it
        turns out no one really likes or wants the result after all. but when
        there’s not a separate evaluation step and payout step, then those
        contingencies are beyond the purview of the funding mechanism to
        influence. trying to fund stuff that won’t fail is baked into the
        prediction and fronting steps.
      </p>
      <p>
        this is especially true for new endeavors. with well-established
        charities and companies, the ability to secure future funding is an
        indirect incentive to execute current projects well. but for new
        organizations that have no track record at all (or sometimes, even
        new projects started by existing organizations), you have to fall
        back on looking at the track record of the people founding them, and
        if the founders are relatively unknown, there’s not much of an
        incentive to give them a chance as opposed to taking safe bets. taking
        big swings that you’ll usually miss on, but that will occasionally have
        wildly outsized returns, is sometimes called “hits-based giving”; some
        effective-altruist organizations explicitly try to use this strategy,
        and the reason it’s even necessary for them to specify that – after
        all, hits-based investing is how venture capital works be default – is
        that the incentives for an individual employee of a typical
        philanthropic foundation, like the incentives for an individual
        bureaucrat, are to be risk-averse and lean toward safe bets rather
        than innovation.

      <h3>
        some mechanisms are “full-stack”; others exist at one or two layers
      </h3>
      <p>
        some mechanisms, like the examples mentioned above, offer an
        implementation of the entire framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        but a large swath of mechanisms can be understood as innovations on
        one or two of the steps. for example:
