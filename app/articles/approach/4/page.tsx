          <strong>predict</strong>
          <p>
            <strong>what does it entail?</strong> make a good guess about which
            projects will be likely to achieve their aims, what impacts those
            achievements will have, and which teams can achieve the best
            results for the lowest cost.

          <p>
            <strong>what are the desirables?</strong> predict accurately and at
            low cost.

            <strong>what does it entail?</strong> make a good guess about which
            projects will be likely to achieve their aims, what impacts those
            achievements will have, and which teams can achieve the best
            results for the lowest cost.

          <strong>execute</strong>
          <p>
            <strong>what does it entail?</strong> carry out the project.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>what are the desirables?</strong> do something people
            actually want. do it well. do it inexpensively.  don’t run off
            with the money.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>evaluate</strong>
          <p>
            <strong>what does it entail?</strong> determine how valuable the
            project was.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>what are the desirables?</strong> align the measure with
            the target – that is, [explain further]. account for
            externalities– for example, [example of private funding][example of
            big donor funding for reputation].
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>pay out</strong>
          <p>
            <strong>what does it entail?</strong> allocate money as a function
            of the evaluation of the project’s impact. in some cases, like
            traditional grantmaking, the fronting is also the payout (although
            to some extent this is a question of definitions; you could also
            think of traditional grantmaking as just skipping the fronting
            step).
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>what are the desirables?</strong> incentivize the execution
            of projects with the most impact.
