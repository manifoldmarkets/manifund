# Updating the AIS Funder Bulletin

This doc is for anyone (human or AI agent) refreshing the funder bulletin at
https://manifund.org/ais-funder-bulletin. All content lives in one file:
`app/ais-funder-bulletin/page.tsx`. There is no database or CMS — edit the
file, open a PR, and merging deploys it.

## File map

- `LAST_UPDATED` (near the top) — display string like `'July 28, 2026'`.
  Bump it whenever you change any content.
- `AT_A_GLANCE: Row[]` — the summary table. Each row: `name`, `href`,
  `donated2025`, `grants2025`, `expected2026` (each a `Cell`), `fte`, and
  booleans `generalApps` / `openRfps` / `donations`.
- `NOTES` — the footnotes, rendered as an ordered list in the "Notes" section.
- `<Funder title="...">` sections — one collapsible profile per funder, each
  with the same nested-list structure: Website / Background / Thesis /
  By the numbers / Recent updates / Get involved.
- "Not included" section — funders deliberately excluded, with rationale.
- "Other resources" — external links.

## Gotchas

- **Footnote coupling:** a `Cell` is `{ v: string; n?: number }` where `n` is a
  **1-based index into `NOTES`** (rendered as `NOTES[n - 1]`). If you insert or
  remove a note, every later `n` in `AT_A_GLANCE` shifts — renumber them.
- **Duplicated note text:** each `NOTES` entry has both a JSX `node` (rendered
  in the Notes section) and a plain-text `text` (the hover tooltip on the
  superscript marker). Keep the two in sync when editing a note.
- **Conventions:** dollar figures are short strings like `'$400M'` / `'$1B'`;
  unknown values are `'—'`; always state years explicitly in prose (e.g.
  "in 2025", not "last year").

## Research process

Be thorough, not timid. The expectation is that **every figure and claim on
the page gets re-verified on every refresh**, not just skimmed for obvious
staleness. A refresh that only tweaks a line or two is almost certainly
under-researched. Never conclude "no change" for a funder from a single
search — do several distinct searches per funder (their site, public grants
database, blog/newsroom, careers page, plus news and community sources like
the EA Forum and LessWrong).

For each funder:

- **Confirm it still exists in its current form.** Check for renames,
  mergers, shutdowns, and successor funds. If a funder has been replaced,
  update everything — At-a-glance row, profile section, footnotes — to
  reflect the successor, and note the transition in the profile.
- **Re-verify every "By the numbers" figure and At-a-glance cell**, including
  current-year grant counts and totals from public grants databases. Add
  current-year figures where they exist (e.g. "N grants so far in 2026"),
  and update footnotes to match what the source now shows.
- **Keep At-a-glance booleans (`generalApps` / `openRfps` / `donations`) in
  sync with the profile text.** If an RFP closes or applications open, flip
  the flag and update the prose in the same PR.
- **For any time-sensitive opportunity whose date has passed**, use the link
  or a search to confirm whether the deadline was extended. If extended,
  update the date; if truly passed, reword to the durable state rather than
  just deleting the mention — e.g. an expired RFP becomes "They post periodic
  RFPs, but otherwise don't accept unsolicited proposals," not silence.
- **Click every link on the page** to verify it still exists and says what is
  claimed.
- **Make changes consistently in both the At-a-glance table and the funder
  profiles** whenever both apply.
- Refresh "Recent updates" bullets with notable grants or announcements, and
  "Get involved" with current job openings.

Also consider whether anything in the "Not included" section should change,
and whether a significant new funder has appeared.

## Editing rules

- Only change facts you can back with a citable source; put the source URL
  next to each change in the PR body.
- If you can't verify a figure after genuinely trying, leave it alone. Never
  estimate or extrapolate numbers.
- The PR body must also include a short per-funder research log: what was
  checked and what was found, including funders where nothing changed. This
  is how the reviewer can tell thorough from lazy.
- Update `LAST_UPDATED` if and only if you changed content.
- If nothing material has changed anywhere, make no edits and open no PR.

## Verification

`bun install && bun run build` must pass before opening a PR.
