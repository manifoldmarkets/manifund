            This is a digest of funders in the AI safety space. The goal is to give an overview of
            who is funding in the space that includes the most relevant information for people
            seeking funds, looking to donate, or looking to work in grantmaking.
          </p>
          <p>
            These tables are a rough summary of the numbers in the digest and the numbers are often
            best guesses based on public info; more detail is in the writeup and the footnotes. For
            funders that do work in multiple cause areas, it only considers grantmaking and staff
            focused on AIS. Some of the funding may repeat between rows—e.g. Coefficient donating to
            BlueDot or AISTOF making grants through Manifund—but this shouldn&apos;t substantially
            change the big-picture numbers.

                      SFF is a virtual fund focused on organizing grant processes to support the
                      long-term survival and flourishing of sentient life. Most grants go to
                      reducing AI x-risk. Jaan Tallinn&apos;s priorities include efforts to restrict
                      AI—datacenter certifications, speed limits, liability laws, labeling
                      requirements, veto committees, and off-switches—as well as constructive
                      efforts to set examples for the positive use of AI—AI assistance for human
                      intelligence, AI healthcare tech, positive moralities, safety specs for AI,
                      and hardware-level AI controls.

                          Speculation Grants are faster grants made outside the S-Process timeline.
                          Around 40 people serve as Speculators, each holding a budget of roughly
                          $400-500k to approve them from.

                          you guarantee eligibility for a round, and SFF says over 95% of
                          applications evaluated in past rounds received one.

                      All three of their 2026 AI safety RFPs have now closed: the science of
                      trustworthy AI (May 17), interpretability (May 26), and multi-agent safety
                      (August 9). Decisions on the first two were due in summer 2026 and on the
                      third in autumn 2026, but no 2026 awardees have been announced yet.
