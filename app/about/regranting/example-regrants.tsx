    amount: 11_000,
    explanation: `I think that understanding, detecting and potentially mitigating chain of thought unfaithfulness is a very important problem, especially with the rise of o1 models... I think Arthur is fairly good at supervising projects, and that under him Jett and Ivan have a decent shot of making progress, and that enabling this to start a month earlier is clearly a good idea.`,

    regrantor_name: 'Leopold Aschenbrenner',

    amount: 200_000,
    explanation: `I think Epoch has done truly outstanding work on core trends in AI progress in the past few years. I'm also excited by their recent foray into benchmarking in the form of FrontierMath... Better benchmarks that help us forecast time to AGI (and especially time to relevant capabilities, such as automated AI research) and do so in a highly credible and scientific way are very valuable for informing policymakers and catalyzing important policy efforts.`,

    amount: 50_000,
    explanation: `I've generally been impressed by how well Timaeus have executed. They've in short order assembled a strong team who are collaborating & working well together, producing substantial research and outreach outputs. They have a distinctive research vision, and I think deserve some credit for popularizing studying the evolution of networks throughout training from an interpretability perspective with e.g. EleutherAI's interpretability team now pursuing their own "development interpretability" flavored research.`,
