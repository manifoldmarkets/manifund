        <h1>AI Safety Regranting</h1>
        <p>
          We partner with <i>regrantors:</i> experts in the field of AI safety,
          each given an independent budget. Regrantors recommend grants based on
          their personal expertise; Manifund reviews these recommendations and
          distributes the funds.

        <h3>Why regranting?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Hidden opportunities:</strong> Regrantors can tap into their
            personal networks, giving to places that donors and grantmaking
            organizations might miss. Rather than wait for an application,
            regrantors can reach out to grantees to initiate new projects.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Fast:</strong> The regrantor is responsible for the budget,
            rather than a committee. The regranting model requires less overhead
            than traditional grantmaking, so we can make grants in days, not
            months.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Flexible:</strong> Regrantors can give to projects that are
            not yet registered as charities, or to individuals; Manifund acts as
            the fiscal sponsor, complying with 501c3 requirements and allowing
            tax benefits for donors.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Trust-based:</strong> Newer fields like AI safety can be
            speculative, opaque, and nascent, making it harder for donors to
            know where to direct their money. Regranting helps donors to
            outsource these decisions to individuals with deep expertise.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>

        <h3>How does regranting on Manifund work?</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            A donor adds money to their Manifund account (which constitutes a
            tax-deductible donation to our 501c3 nonprofit).
          </li>
          <li>
            The donor can then allocate the money between regrantors of their
            choice (or they can give directly to projects).
          </li>
          <li>
            Regrantors choose which opportunities, including projects posted on
            Manifund through our open call or projects they learn about
            elsewhere, to spend their budgets on, writing up an explanation for
            each grant made.
          </li>
          <li>
            We review the grant to make sure it is legitimate, legal, and
            aligned with our mission.
          </li>
          <li>
            If we approve the grant, the money will be transferred to the
            grantee&apos;s Manifund account, at which point they request to
            withdraw and we send them their funds.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>FAQ</h3>
        <strong>Who can see the information about grants?</strong>
        <br />
        <p>
          Currently all grant information is made public. This includes the
          identity of the regrantor and grant recipient, the project
          description, the grant size, and the regrantor’s writeup.
        </p>
        <p>
          We strongly believe in transparency as it allows for meaningful public
          feedback, accountability of decisions, and establishment of a
          regrantor track records. We recognize that not all grants are suited
          for publishing; for now, we recommend such grants be made through
          other funders, such as the Long Term Future Fund, the Survival and
          Flourishing Fund, or Open Philanthropy.
        </p>
        <strong>What kinds of projects are eligible for regranting?</strong>
        <br />
        <p>
          We have no official cause-area restrictions on grants, though most of
          our regrantors are focused on mitigating global catastrophic risk,
          specifically on AI safety.
        </p>
        <p>
          We support regrants to registered charities and individuals.
          For-profit organizations may also be eligible, pending due diligence.
          As a US-registered 501c3, we do not generally permit donations to
          political campaigns or lobbying.
        </p>
        <p>
          We look over all grants before fulfilling withdrawal requests to make
          sure they meet these requirements. We reserve the right to veto grants
          for any reason, though we expect to often defer to our regrantors’
          judgement.
        </p>
        <strong>Can regrantors send money to their own projects?</strong>
        <br />
        <p>
          In certain circumstances, we allow regrantors to give to projects they
          advise, or are otherwise involved with; we evaluate these projects
          with a more rigorous bar before fulfilling withdrawal requests. We
          generally do not permit regrantors to pay for their own salaries.

        <strong>Can I contribute funds to the regrantor budgets?</strong>
        <p>
          Yes! We&apos;re looking for contributions to our AI Safety regrantor
          budgets. If you&apos;re donating a substantial amount (eg $50k+), we
          can also work with you to nominate specific regrantors who share your
          values and interests. We do ask large donors to cover a 5% fiscal
          sponsorship fee, which offsets our operational costs & salaries.
