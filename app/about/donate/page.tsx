            <li>
              <strong>
                There are specific regrantors you would trust to donate on your
                behalf.
              </strong>{' '}
              That is, there are experts in the areas you support who you think,
              relative to you, have a comparative advantage giving your money to
              the best projects in that area. These people don&apos;t
              necessarily need to be on our site already; if you have someone in
              mind you&apos;d like to sponsor, book a call and we can talk
              through facilitating that!
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>You value transparency.</strong> When you give through
              Manifund, you&apos;ll be able to see where your money goes and
              why.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>You believe in other benefits of our approach.</strong> We
              think that the speed, transparency, and experimentation aspects of
              our approach have big positive externalities for our grantees and
              for philanthropy at large. When projects get funded faster, they
              can start sooner. By being transparent, we provide information to
              everyone about what grantmakers look for, help build grantmaker
              trackrecords, keep ourselves accountable to public opinion, and
              put pressure on other funders to be more transparent. By
              experimenting with alternative mechanisms, we have the potential
              to find better approaches to non-profit funding that could be
              applied elsewhere.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Why not donate through regranting?</h2>
          You might not want to donate through regranting if you have strong
          takes on which projects within the cause area you care most about are
          the highest impact, and want to devote your own time to evaluating
          projects and charities yourself. In that case, you might think
          outsourcing your donation decisions to a regrantor would result in the
          money going to less impactful projects than if you distributed it
          personally.

          <h2>FAQ</h2>
          <strong>
            If I donate to a regrantor or a fund, can I maintain veto power over
            grants they give?
          </strong>
          <p>
            No. We think the extra coordination involved would be costly for
            donors, regrantors, and grantees, without meaningfully improving the
            quality of our grants.
          </p>
          <strong>Are donations to Manifund tax deductible?</strong>
          <p>
            Yes if you&apos;re in the US! Manifold for Charity, our
            organization, is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit.
          </p>
          <strong>Why do take a 5% cut of donations?</strong>
          <p>
            We need to cover our costs somehow, and we see two main ways of
            doing that: taking a small cut of all donations, or fundraising
            separately for our operations. We choose the former because we get a
            better signal on the value of our work by pricing it in. If the work
            we do building and maintaining the site, onboarding and managing
            regrantors, and processing grants doesn&apos;t add as much value to
            donors as it costs, then that&apos;s a useful signal that we
            shouldn&apos;t be doing it anymore.
          </p>
          <strong>
            What if I&apos;m interested in donating through regranting, but
            I&apos;m interested in a different cause from any of your
            regrantors?
          </strong>
          <p>
            Book a time to talk to us! We might be able to set you up with
            regrantors you trust who have expertise in your area of choice.
